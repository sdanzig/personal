Here we are in Waikiki, listening to this Expedia "Local Expert" tell
us about all these activities we can sign up for.&nbsp; They provided
some fruit and a croissant in exchange for us listening to their sales
pitch.&nbsp; We signed up for about $1400 worth of activities.&nbsp; We
ended up paying about $400 of it, and successfully disputing the rest
of the charges, since there was a lot we were promised that they didn't
deliver.&nbsp; Some activities were good, some were bad.. if you go
with Expedia, get everything you care about in writing.<br>

<br>

<br>

<img src="images/hawaii/hawaii_1212.jpg" alt=""><br>

The orientation did include a fun little dance demonstration.<br>

<br>

<br>

<img src="images/hawaii/hawaii_1224.jpg" alt=""><br>

We wandered around looking for sushi afterward.&nbsp; The orientation
host caught up with us and took our picture.&nbsp; We didn't know she
was so evil back then, so we were smiling.<br>

<br>

<br>

<img src="images/hawaii/hawaii_1225.jpg" alt=""><br>

In the water behind us, many fish gathered, desperately trying to warn us.<br>

<br>

<br>

<img src="images/hawaii/hawaii_1226.jpg" alt=""><br>

On the way we see some interesting buildings like this one.<br>

<br>

<br>

<img src="images/hawaii/hawaii_1234.jpg" alt=""><br>

The Royal Hawaiian is the 5 star hotel we stayed at.&nbsp; It certainly
was the most exquisite hotel I've ever stayed in.&nbsp; See me
appreciating the hotel's exquisiteness.<br>

<br>

<br>

<img src="images/hawaii/hawaii_1238.jpg" alt=""><br>

Aliona's mother loves flowers, so we made sure to get plenty of flower pictures.<br>

<br>

<br>

<img src="images/hawaii/hawaii_1239.jpg" alt=""><br>

The hallway of the Royal Hawaiian opens up to this green
courtyard.&nbsp; This is important, because everything in the Royal
Hawaiian is pink.&nbsp; That's why this page is pink too.&nbsp; It's
classy, but I had my fill of pink by the end of the vacation.<br>

<br>

<br>

<img src="images/hawaii/hawaii_1244.jpg" alt=""><br>

Delicate white flowers captures Aliona's innocence.<br>

<br>

<br>

<img src="images/hawaii/hawaii_1248.jpg" alt=""><br>

Waikiki is probably the most touristy beach in Hawaii.&nbsp; That said,
it's still paradise, and we had a clear view of it from our room.&nbsp;
It was fun to people watch.<br>

<br>

<br>

<img src="images/hawaii/hawaii_1253.jpg" alt=""><br>

One of the activities we were sold and refunded was surf lessons, and
we had them here.&nbsp; Our instructor was plainly a jerk who didn't
want to bother with us.&nbsp; I did manage to stand on the board for
maybe 8-10 seconds, but I really didn't learn much at all from the
instructor.&nbsp; Aliona was clearly frustrated as well.<br>

<br>

<br>

<img src="images/hawaii/hawaii_1255.jpg" alt=""><br>

All was forgotten at the Hotel's "Mai Tai" bar.<br>

<br>

<br>

<img src="images/hawaii/hawaii_1263.jpg" alt=""><br>

As part of a hotel package which netted us a discount on parking and
internet, we were given four coupons for virgin blue hawaiians.&nbsp;
Basically 4 glasses of sweet blue juice, which neither of us
wanted.&nbsp; We liked the pineapple slice, but not the blue
juice.&nbsp; I later decided to give our last two coupons to a nice elderly couple who appreciated them far more than we ever would have.<br>

<br>

<br>

<img src="images/hawaii/hawaii_1268.jpg" alt=""><br>

These drinks were so beautiful, so it was hard not to keep taking pictures of them.<br>

<br>

<br>

<img src="images/hawaii/hawaii_1269.jpg" alt=""><br>

It was also hard not to keep drinking them.<br>

<br>

<br>

<img src="images/hawaii/hawaii_1285.jpg" alt=""><br>

As we walked behind the hotel at night, we found a grassy field that
looked like it wasn't meant to be walked on.&nbsp; We took off our
shoes and frolicked about.<br>

<br>

<br>

<img src="images/hawaii/hawaii_1290.jpg" alt=""><br>

This is Aliona looking pretty with the flower she found at the souvenir
shop.&nbsp; She also found a wonderful little coconut-watch, painted
blue, shaped like a cat.&nbsp; It was her treasured prize, but once we
got home, it stopped working.&nbsp; I mailed it back and miraculously,
we got a replacement 2 months later.&nbsp; It also didn't work
right.&nbsp; We're still waiting for the second replacement.<br>

<br>

<br>

<img src="images/hawaii/hawaii_1291.jpg" alt=""><br>

Aliona intended to get a nice Hawaiian dress for a souvenir, but she judged it just wasn't her style.<br>

<br>

<br>

<img src="images/hawaii/hawaii_1292.jpg" alt=""><br>

Perhaps this is her style?<br>

<br>

<br>

<img src="images/hawaii/hawaii_1294.jpg" alt=""><br>

The next day we set off for our next activities, parasailing and
jetskiing.&nbsp; We found out jetskiing was cancelled, so we got a
refund.&nbsp; Parasailng was fun, but they didn't send us up to the
height we were promised, so this was free as well.&nbsp; The dudes on
the boat were a handful, making jokes all the time while driving the
boat super-fast.<br>
<br>
<br>
<img src="images/hawaii/hawaii_007_5.jpg" alt=""><br>

Our turn came and the parachute mercilessly pulled us into the
air.&nbsp; Okay, this isn't exactly that time.&nbsp; We just got dipped
into the water after being in the air for a while, but you'll see that
later.<br>
<br>
<br>
<img src="images/hawaii/hawaii_018_16.jpg" alt=""><br>


Here's us high in the sky as the boat's turning.&nbsp; The wind was a
little unsettling and my hands were gripping the parachute straps with
white knuckles, but at times I was able to relax and enjoy it.&nbsp;
Aliona enjoyed all of it.<br>


<br>


<br>


<img src="images/hawaii/hawaii_019_17.jpg" alt=""><br>

Here's the view of the coast we had.<br>
<br>
<br>
<img src="images/hawaii/hawaii_009_7.jpg" alt=""><br>



The guys running the show decided to dip everyone in the water once or
twice before reeling them back in.&nbsp; We were no exception.<br>



<br>



<br>



<img src="images/hawaii/hawaii_015_13.jpg" alt=""><br>
And... we're in.&nbsp; I wasn't sure if sharks were eating Aliona at
this point, but I think all of her survived so probably not.<br>
<br>
<br>

<img src="images/hawaii/hawaii_1312.jpg" alt=""><br>

This was the balcony for our 5th floor room.&nbsp; Aliona likes balconies.<br>

<br>

<br>

<img src="images/hawaii/hawaii_1318.jpg" alt=""><br>

She also likes my jokes.&nbsp; A few of them.<br>

<br>

<br>

<img src="images/hawaii/hawaii_1330.jpg" alt=""><br>

This is the dorkiest picture ever taken of me, but the view still makes it a beautiful shot.<br>

<br>

<br>

<img src="images/hawaii/hawaii_1349.jpg" alt=""><br>

We treated ourselves to some of the fancy food at the Waikiki hotels.<br>

<br>

<br>

<img src="images/hawaii/hawaii_1350.jpg" alt=""><br>

Looking behind me, I saw this shark doing the same.&nbsp; There's apparently a kid in that shark.<br>

<br>

<br>

<img src="images/hawaii/hawaii_1352.jpg" alt=""><br>

This is the sampling station of a Waikiki cookie store.<br>

<br>

<br>

<img src="images/hawaii/hawaii_1354.jpg" alt=""><br>

These exotic plants decorate a shopping area.<br>

<br>

<br>

<img src="images/hawaii/hawaii_1373.jpg" alt=""><br>

The third activity, which we willingly paid for, was a sea kayaking
tour.&nbsp; Aliona and I aren't the most coordinated rowing pair, but
what we lacked in skill we made up for with... well, we managed
fine.&nbsp; There were four young girls full of excitement that left
everyone in the dust, constantly yapping and singing cheerful pop
music.&nbsp; You'd think they'd be annoying, but they were so
over-the-top, you couldn't help but laugh with them.<br>

<br>

<br>

<img src="images/hawaii/hawaii_1392.jpg" alt=""><br>

Me immersing myself in the peaceful emerald waters, wearing my rocky
necklace that Aliona made fun of, awaiting spiritual guidance from the
heavens.<br>

<br>

<br>

<img src="images/hawaii/hawaii_1397.jpg" alt=""><br>

On one of the islands we stopped at, little endangered birds nested.<br>

<br>

<br>

<img src="images/hawaii/hawaii_1400.jpg" alt=""><br>

This is a rare shot of an extremely fluffy little baby endangered bird.<br>

<br>

<br>

<img src="images/hawaii/hawaii_1412.jpg" alt=""><br>

We were taking turns diving into a little pool of water that in the past, some form of royalty bathed in.<br>

<br>

<br>

<img src="images/hawaii/hawaii_1416.jpg" alt=""><br>

We took the plunge and our picture was taken shortly after.&nbsp; I think something or someone is tickling me here.<br>

<br>

<br>

<img src="images/hawaii/hawaii_1419.jpg" alt=""><br>

You have to be a talented photographer to take a bad picture in Hawaii.<br>

<br>

<br>

<img src="images/hawaii/hawaii_1420.jpg" alt=""><br>

This is the remains of the massive rock monster that tried to sink our
kayaks.&nbsp; I climbed to the top and tore off its stalactite fangs,
one by one, until it fainted and crashed into the sea, never to rise
its head again.&nbsp; Okay, I'm just trying to see if anyone's still reading.<br>

<br>

<br>

<img src="images/hawaii/hawaii_1422.jpg" alt=""><br>

While the tour guide is merely explaining a point about some nearby
islands, using directional hand gestures, it really does look like he
just karate-chopped a ninja.<br>

<br>

<br>

<img src="images/hawaii/hawaii_1425.jpg" alt=""><br>
This looks like an artist's inspired splotches of paint.<br>

<br>

<br>

<img src="images/hawaii/hawaii_1434.jpg" alt=""><br>

Lanikai beach is a top beach in America, our tour guide said.&nbsp; We
mainly cared about Chubby.&nbsp; These laid-back dudes had a dog that
knew how to chill.&nbsp; We wanted to learn from Chillmaster Chubby.<br>

<br>

<br>

<img src="images/hawaii/hawaii_1437.jpg" alt=""><br>

Here's Aliona scratching behind the ear of Chillmaster Chubby.<br>

<br>

<br>

<img src="images/hawaii/hawaii_1439.jpg" alt=""><br>

Our kayaking tour group.&nbsp; You can see the four easily identifiable
hyper-active girls in front of the tour guide.&nbsp; Their energy of
these Spice Girls never faltered throughout the trip which took up most
of the day.<br>

<br>

<br>

<img src="images/hawaii/hawaii_1441.jpg" alt=""><br>

A side view of Lanikai Beach before we took off, complete with the breezy palm trees.<br>

<br>

<br>

<img src="images/hawaii/hawaii_1445.jpg" alt=""><br>

That night we had reservations for our rooftop luau.&nbsp; We were
seated with a nice Japanese family that didn't speak a word of
English.&nbsp; Hawaii is near Japan so they are certainly
well-represented.&nbsp; It was windy on the rooftop, so I thought one
of the two coupons for drinks had blown away.&nbsp; I had to argue for
my second pina colada, but then I found the coupon under my
plate.&nbsp; My bad.<br>

<br>

<br>

<img src="images/hawaii/hawaii_1451.jpg" alt=""><br>

Many Hawaiian dances advertise various props and costumes, depicted
here, available for purchase in the luau's souvenir shop.&nbsp; We were
very well fed, however.&nbsp; For instance, all the tuna sashimi we
could eat!<br>

<br>

<br>

<img src="images/hawaii/hawaii_1471.jpg" alt=""><br>

If you've seen enough of my pictures, you'd know I can't pass up a good rainbow pic.<br>

<br>

<br>

<img src="images/hawaii/hawaii_1502.jpg" alt=""><br>

During brunch, Aliona returns with a bowl of seaweed salad, and yogurt,
only to find a pesky intruder making his escape from her chair.<br>

<br>

<br>

<img src="images/hawaii/hawaii_1504.jpg" alt=""><br>

Me hungry for more food.&nbsp; Something in my blood compels my stomach to digest faster at buffets.<br>

<br>

<br>

<img src="images/hawaii/hawaii_1526.jpg" alt=""><br>

This hotel had a serious bird problem, especially at this table.<br>

<br>

<br>

<img src="images/hawaii/hawaii_1531.jpg" alt=""><br>

We drove up the North Shore toward Sunset Beach, thinking it would be a
good place to see a sunset, along with some champion surfers.&nbsp;
Along the way, we couldn't pass up this roadside market which sells
local foods such as pineapple, dragonfruit, and pickled mango.&nbsp; I,
unfortunately, could not resist the pickled mango.<br>

<br>

<br>

<img src="images/hawaii/hawaii_1533.jpg" alt=""><br>

We found a nice beach spot and parked next to this truck.&nbsp; He was a good friend of Chillmaster Chubby.<br>

<br>

<br>

<img src="images/hawaii/hawaii_1534.jpg" alt=""><br>

I dug my feet into the sand, preparing for the sunset.<br>

<br>

<br>

<img src="images/hawaii/hawaii_1548.jpg" alt=""><br>

Aliona set up the hotel towels, preparing for our fruity picnic at sunset.<br>

<br>

<br>

<img src="images/hawaii/hawaii_1555.jpg" alt=""><br>

I love lychees.&nbsp; Did I mention we bought lychees at the market too?&nbsp; Here's me peeling a lychee nut.<br>

<br>

<br>

<img src="images/hawaii/hawaii_1563.jpg" alt=""><br>

We had a newspaper of some sort with us for some reason, and while on
this gorgeous, peaceful beach, the wind swept some pages away.&nbsp; I
was determined not to spoil this beach with my trash, so I ran what
amounted to a quarter mile chasing the pages.&nbsp; On the way, another
boyfriend felt bad for me and joined in the chase.&nbsp; He collected
the pages and I was thankful.&nbsp; On the way back, some pages got
loose again, and I ran another tenth a mile.&nbsp; I gave up and as I
walked back in defeat, Aliona took this picture and giggled.<br>

<br>

<br>

<img src="images/hawaii/hawaii_1565.jpg" alt=""><br>

We weren't on Sunset Beach.&nbsp; That beach was a bit crowded, with no
trees.&nbsp; Aliona insisted we find something better, and we drove
down a mile to this beach.&nbsp; It was much better, and shockingly, it
had a nice sunset too.<br>

<br>

<br>

<img src="images/hawaii/hawaii_1575.jpg" alt=""><br>

As the sun set, a creepy monster attacked me.<br>

<br>

<br>

<img src="images/hawaii/hawaii_1587.jpg" alt=""><br>

The cloudy gray sky and sweeping waves made for a dramatic backdrop for Aliona's pose.<br>

<br>

<br>

<img src="images/hawaii/hawaii_1599.jpg" alt=""><br>

Here's why it was unfortunate I purchased and subsequently got hooked on pickled mango.<br>

<br>

<br>

<img src="images/hawaii/hawaii_1610.jpg" alt=""><br>

We found a seafood place on the way back with some nice
cocktails.&nbsp; I think the seafood was good.&nbsp; I can't
remember.&nbsp; Okay, I didn't drink much at all because I had to
eventually drive home, so Aliona had a lot of work to do.<br>

<br>

<br>

<img src="images/hawaii/hawaii_1612.jpg" alt=""><br>

Here's the plane that would take us to the Big Island for our volcano
tour.&nbsp; We admittedly had a good time, but the entire tour ended up
being free.&nbsp; It was difficult to dispute this charge, but we were
promised to see volcanoes, the Kona coffee plantation, and a historic
village.&nbsp; The tour ended up only including volcanoes, so I
persevered.<br>

<br>

<br>

<img src="images/hawaii/hawaii_1615.jpg" alt=""><br>

Aliona opens one of her organic fruit strip snacks.<br>

<br>

<br>

<img src="images/hawaii/hawaii_1639.jpg" alt=""><br>

On the Big Island, we stopped at this Japanese garden for some photos.<br>

<br>

<br>

<img src="images/hawaii/hawaii_1652.jpg" alt=""><br>

More proof I was there too.<br>

<br>

<br>

<img src="images/hawaii/hawaii_1657.jpg" alt=""><br>

Aliona's hair flows like a waterfall.&nbsp; See?<br>

<br>

<br>

<img src="images/hawaii/hawaii_1662.jpg" alt=""><br>

The creepy beach monster almost caught up to me here.&nbsp; She chewed
on my brains for a while but I stuffed them back in my skull and ran
away.<br>

<br>

<br>

<img src="images/hawaii/hawaii_1683.jpg" alt=""><br>

Everyone told us to go down a path to see a beautiful watery
cove.&nbsp; We did and were happy we made the time for it.&nbsp; Being
on a tour, everything was much more rushed than we would have liked.<br>

<br>

<br>

<img src="images/hawaii/hawaii_1692.jpg" alt=""><br>
A massive active volcano waits to erupt behind Aliona.<br>

<br>

<br>

<img src="images/hawaii/hawaii_1712.jpg" alt=""><br>

Aliona runs away from said volcano.<br>

<br>

<br>

<img src="images/hawaii/hawaii_1716.jpg" alt=""><br>

I swiftly come to the rescue.<br>

<br>

<br>

<img src="images/hawaii/hawaii_1733.jpg" alt=""><br>

Here's us exploring a lava tube.&nbsp; The tour guide told us not to go
into a pitch black hole that supposedly is very difficult to navigate
past and only leads to a deadend.&nbsp; Contrary to our true nature, we
decided to skip it and followed everyone else like lemmings.<br>

<br>

<br>

<img src="images/hawaii/hawaii_1739.jpg" alt=""><br>

We got out just in time, before everybody else got burned alive, their ashes swallowed up into the earth's core.<br>

<br>

<br>

<img src="images/hawaii/hawaii_1750.jpg" alt=""><br>

As a veteran of the volcanic underground, I decided to look the part.<br>

<br>

<br>

<img src="images/hawaii/hawaii_1753.jpg" alt=""><br>

Pele's hair is a nickname for the hair-like strands formed from a volcanic blast.&nbsp; It really looks like hair, see?<br>

<br>

<br>

<img src="images/hawaii/hawaii_1755.jpg" alt=""><br>

This was a very active volcano.&nbsp; Iceland's are much more
dangerous, but this steam still singed my eyebrows when I leaned over it.<br>

<br>

<br>

<img src="images/hawaii/hawaii_1760.jpg" alt=""><br>

It was fun to line the steam up with Aliona's head, especially when she looked serious.<br>

<br>

<br>

<img src="images/hawaii/hawaii_1768.jpg" alt=""><br>

There was steam all over the place.<br>

<br>

<br>

<img src="images/hawaii/hawaii_1771.jpg" alt=""><br>

Aliona likes both flowers, and butterflies, so this made her happy.<br>

<br>

<br>

<img src="images/hawaii/hawaii_1780.jpg" alt=""><br>

Surfaces of volcanic rock are perfect for sci-fi movies.<br>

<br>

<br>

<img src="images/hawaii/hawaii_1784.jpg" alt=""><br>

I took this intending it to make it grayscale and turn it into an artsy photograph.<br>

<br>

<br>

<img src="images/hawaii/hawaii_1796.jpg" alt=""><br>

We also stopped at a black sand beach.&nbsp; They had this straw hut we
hid away in, eating pineapple while enjoying the exotic scenery.&nbsp;
I've been on a black sand beach in Positano, Italy, but this was worlds
more enjoyable.<br>

<br>

<br>

<img src="images/hawaii/hawaii_1803.jpg" alt=""><br>

Aliona takes a nap on a rock, her belly filled with pineapple.<br>

<br>

<br>

<img src="images/hawaii/hawaii_1840.jpg" alt=""><br>

There was an active volcano with an exposed lava flow, but it was
deemed unsafe for us to get near it.&nbsp; The lava was flowing into
the water, and we were able to take a picture of the resulting steam,
glowing red from the lava.<br>

<br>

<br>

<img src="images/hawaii/hawaii_1847.jpg" alt=""><br>

While we never stopped at the Kona coffee plantation, we made sure to
have our 100% Kona coffee at a nice restaurant when we got back.&nbsp;
Coffee is an acquired taste.&nbsp; In other words, most children won't
drink it.&nbsp; This coffee is smooth enough where I think most could
drink it.&nbsp; Aliona, however, consists of 70% coffee so this was
very rejuvenating for her.<br>

<br>

<br>

<img src="images/hawaii/hawaii_1856.jpg" alt=""><br>

While sipping coffee, I noticed this bird's head was a bright color.<br>

<br>

<br>

<img src="images/hawaii/hawaii_1858.jpg" alt=""><br>

After the bird had moved aside, we posed for this picture.<br>

<br>

<br>

<img src="images/hawaii/hawaii_1863.jpg" alt=""><br>

One of the hotels had a pool that had a nearly invisible edge, so it blended with the ocean.<br>

<br>

<br>

<img src="images/hawaii/hawaii_1871.jpg" alt=""><br>

Occasionally we saw people drinking from pineapples so we had to try it.&nbsp; After we were done, we devoured the remainder of the pineapple.<br>

<br>

<br>

<img src="images/hawaii/hawaii_1872.jpg" alt=""><br>

The bartender saw how much we loved pineapple, so he carved up another one for us.<br>

<br>

<br>

<img src="images/hawaii/hawaii_1877.jpg" alt=""><br>

Our bed was very comfortable, or so Aliona tells me.&nbsp; I couldn't
tell, because she likes sleeping diagonally across the bed.<br>

<br>

<br>

<img src="images/hawaii/hawaii_1891.jpg" alt=""><br>

Here's another good shot of the view we had from our room.<br>

<br>

<br>

<img src="images/hawaii/hawaii_1899.jpg" alt=""><br>

I thought the bed was finally free, but Aliona quickly ran in front of me and jumped back onto it.<br>

<br>

<br>

<img src="images/hawaii/hawaii_1901.jpg" alt=""><br>

I decided, enough was enough, and I launched myself onto the bed, not caring if she was still napping.<br>

<br>

<br>

<img src="images/hawaii/hawaii_1907.jpg" alt=""><br>

Dizzy from the collision, we posed for our last picture in our wonderful room at the Royal Hawaiian.<br>

<br>

<br>

<img src="images/hawaii/hawaii_1911.jpg" alt=""><br>

Many trees in Hawaii look like bundles of roots.<br>

<br>

<br>

<img src="images/hawaii/hawaii_1914.jpg" alt=""><br>

Here was the place we deemed as the best froyo spot in all of Hawaii.&nbsp; There was really no contest.<br>

<br>

<br>

<img src="images/hawaii/hawaii_1916.jpg" alt=""><br>

Checking out of the hotel, we saw decided to pose next to another flower decoration.<br>

<br>

<br>

<img src="images/hawaii/hawaii_1919.jpg" alt=""><br>

We stopped at grocery store to get some apples for the flight
home.&nbsp; We were not allowed to bring them onto the plane
though.&nbsp; These pigeons in the parking lot tried to warn us.<br>

<br>

<br>

<img src="images/hawaii/hawaii_1920.jpg" alt=""><br>

They sell these strings of fresh orchids in the grocery store.<br>

<br>

<br>

<img src="images/hawaii/hawaii_1925.jpg" alt=""><br>

Our vacation finally came to a close, and we learned that Laguardia
airport is pretty nice.&nbsp; This coffee shop just opened up there and
sells my favorite coffee.&nbsp; Not Kona, but we couldn't afford more
of that anyway.&nbsp; As a last note, it looks like one of these guys
has a coffee grinder for a head.<br>
