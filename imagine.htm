Cyle McKai, the Angelic Dreams web site exists.&nbsp; It's not maintained by me
at all, just proofread once in a while, but it provides information on a lot of
things I'm involved with.&nbsp; This includes the entire Split Infinity website
(</font><font size="4" color="#FF9933"><a href="http://www.si.nu/"><font color="#00FFFF">www.si.nu</font></a></font><font size="4"> points to that
section of it.), Mystic Realms (the role-playing game I participate in), and
Japanese animation (anime).&nbsp; It's extremely popular considering it's not
advertised anywhere and I suggest you go visit it to see why.</font></p>
