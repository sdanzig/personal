<p align="left"><b><font size="5" color="#00CCFF">A personal hobby of mine is
watching Japanese animation (referred to with the proper Japanese name for it,
&quot;anime&quot;).&nbsp; You might originally see this and be reminded of
everyday cartoons, but there's a reason behind the millions of people in the
world who are addicted to watching, talking about, philosophizing, subtitling,
and even bootlegging them.&nbsp; Anime are animations that are unrestrained in
artistic expression, serious drama, violence and vulgarity (there is even
pornographic anime, yes).&nbsp; Often historical influence can be found
throughout an anime, skillfully blended with the essence of modern
society.&nbsp; Most anime is originally created with the voices speaking in
Japanese.&nbsp; When we see them in America, either they're bought by an
American company, given English subtitles or subbing, and sold to us for often
$20 to $30 per tape.&nbsp; Another situation is if they're not bought up and
simply copied and &quot;fansubbed&quot;.&nbsp; This means usually that a
non-profit group of otaku (the term for the worst of the anime addicts) made use
of their all-too-expensive video editing hardware to give the anime
professional, well-timed subtitles.&nbsp; Unfortunately, those who translate the
Japanese to English usually can't spell if their lives depended on it and the
subtitles are rippled with grammatical errors, spelling errors, and other silly
typos.</font></b></p>

seen anime yet a taste of what anime looks like, and to show off my good taste
to those who do watch it, I've put pictures of my favorite anime characters
below with captions.</b></font></p>

<img border="0" src="images/anime/kagero.jpg" align="right" alt="Kagero from Ninja Scroll" width="192" height="225">Kagero
of the Koga Ninja from the anime &quot;Ninja Scroll&quot; is definitely a
favorite of mine because of the creativity that went into the development of her
character.&nbsp; She has poisonous blood which makes her immune to all
poisons.&nbsp; Also, however, her touch is lethal to other people for the same
reason.&nbsp; In the anime, she actually helps defeat a monstrous rock-skinned
creature by letting him molest her poisoned body.</b></font></p>

<img border="0" src="images/anime/misato.jpg" align="left" alt="Misato Katsuragi from Neon Genesis Evangelion" width="192" height="144">Misato
Katsuragi from the anime &quot;Neon Genesis Evangelion&quot; is a favorite
character throughout the male population for a number of reasons.&nbsp; She's
beautiful, she's tough, and she drinks beer for breakfast. Aside from all the
adolescents that ogle her, she's lusted after mainly by Kaji Ryouji, a former
boyfriend whom she started dating mainly because he reminded her of the father
that sacrificed his life to save her.</b></font></p>

<img border="0" src="images/anime/raiel.jpg" align="right" alt="Raiel from Violinist of Hamelin" width="192" height="134">Here's
a favorite that no one would guess.&nbsp; He's introduced in the anime movie
&quot;Violinist of Hamelin&quot; as &quot;the master of the golden piano, Raiel,
the warrior of love&quot;.&nbsp; He's manly enough to tote an entire piano on
his back wherever he goes.&nbsp; Here's the twist though.&nbsp; I've actually
only seen the movie version of this anime, and not the TV series. All
throughout the movie, he never actually does anything.&nbsp; How many characters
do you see carry something as large as a piano throughout an entire story and
never actually do anything?&nbsp; However, the main character, Harmel, actually
does a couple of things with him.&nbsp; In this picture, he's crying out in
despair about how the party's main fighter, Sizer, fell down a deep dark pit
(despite the fact that Sizer had wings and could fly out).&nbsp; Soon after,
Harmel kicks Raiel into that same pit because he was starting to get
annoying.&nbsp; Later on, Raiel is turned to stone by a medusa and Harmel hurls
the stone Raiel at the medusa, resulting in Raiel getting broken into tiny
little pieces.&nbsp; That's all this guy ever did in the entire short yet
exciting thirty minute movie.</b></font></p>

<img border="0" src="images/anime/sano.jpg" align="left" alt="Sagara Sanosuke from Rurouni Kenshin" width="192" height="291">
Sagara Sanosuke is my favorite character from my favorite anime, &quot;Rurouni Kenshin&quot;.&nbsp; He's
one of the two remaining from the Sekihoutai tribe formerly a thug hired to
fight the main character, Kenshin. Rurouni Kenshin wins the fight and Sanosuke
ends up befriending him, realizing that Kenshin is different from what he
expected.&nbsp; Sanosuke is a bad ass who wears a red headband, has the Japanese
symbol for &quot;evil&quot; on his back, and after Kenshin broke his massive
sword, fights with his bare fists alone.&nbsp; It is frequently pointed out
throughout the anime series that he strongly resembles a chicken.&nbsp; However,
this chicken's hobby is to knock down trees in one punch and turn large rocks
into dust.&nbsp; Furthermore, there are many instances throughout the anime
series where it looks like it's curtains for Sanosuke.&nbsp; Every time though,
he gets back up and asks for more, often even going on to win the fight.</b></font></p>

<img border="0" src="images/anime/umi.jpg" align="right" alt="Umi Ryuuzak from Magic Knights Rayearth" width="192" height="343">Umi Ryuuzak from the anime
&quot;Magic Knights Rayearth&quot; is a girl who although might be seen as
selfish at first, cares deeply about her friends, Hikaru and Fuu.&nbsp; Like her
friends, she's a school girl who was magically abducted from Tokyo, Wizard of Oz
style.&nbsp; Back in Tokyo, she was looking forward to competing in a fencing
tournament, but in the magical world of Cephiro, she has an ultra-cool robot she
can wear, a triad of watery yet powerful spells to cast, and tons of more
strange things to complain about.&nbsp; There's also this annoying bunny named
Mokona that accompanies her and her friends in Cephiro.&nbsp; This bunny is so
annoying that it only says one word over and over again, acting all cute, &quot;ba
BA ba ba BA!&quot;.&nbsp; Umi is one of my favorite characters because she's the
one that actually attacks the bunny once in a while to keep it in line.</b></font></p>

<img border="0" src="images/anime/slayn.jpg" align="left" alt="Slayn from Record of Lodoss War" width="192" height="144">Last
but not least is the sorceror, Slayn, from the anime &quot;Record of Lodoss
War&quot;.&nbsp; This humble guy is normally a recluse who studies magic in
peace.&nbsp; However, he comes out of hiding to use his magic to save a
village.&nbsp; One of the people he saves is Parn, another main character who is
portrayed as an extremely brave yet rather stupid and untrained warrior.&nbsp;
Slayn decides to travel with Parn, convinced that this nuisance was meant to
serve a higher purpose.&nbsp; Slayn uses his powerful yet not fully developed
magic to aid his fellow adventurers where he can.&nbsp; The reason he's my
favorite character in this anime is perhaps my poorest reason yet.&nbsp; Every
once in a while, Slayn's magic will prove to be not enough, and his enemy will
take advantage of this, attacking him, sending him flying into a wall.&nbsp;
When this happens, his fellow adventurers shout out &quot;Slayn!&quot; and I
just think that's funny.</b></font></p>
