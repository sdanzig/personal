<p><font size="5" color="#C0C0C0">I tried to follow a recipe I found on the Food Network web site.  This was classified as "easy", according to them. Picture a 6 serving croissant wrap stuffed with cold cuts.  The major flaws with the recipe, was that it called for more than twice the amount of meat that you could reasonably put in the snake, and also, when baked, ham oozes a large amount of water.</font></p>

<p><font size="5" color="#C0C0C0">So, instead of getting a cute little snake like pictured alongside the recipe...</font></p>

<p><font size="5" color="#C0C0C0">The most striking difference you will notice is the coloring.  The recipe allows for creativity when you paint the snake (with food coloring).  There are olives for eyes, and cloves for nostrils. In this picture, you can't really see the misplaced roasted pepper tongue.  I was going to fix the tongue after the baking was complete, but I looked at this short, fat worm and decided not to bother.  During the baking, one of the eyes drooped, like the hunchback of Notre Dame.  This convinced me to replace the olives with new ones. I am quite proud of my worm's war paint though.</font></p>

<p><font size="5" color="#C0C0C0">As you can see here, it did taste good.  However, note all the liquid that oozed out.  I also had to mop up a lot of liquid while the thing was baking.</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="5" color="#C0C0C0">Figured it was worth a laugh. I'll make this again, but with much less meat, and without ham.</font></p>
