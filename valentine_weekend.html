Weekend, February 11th, 2012</h1>

It took all the nudging in the world, but I finally convinced Aliona
that it was important to be in front of our building at precisely
noon.&nbsp; The stretch limo was waiting for us, and we hopped in.<br>
<br>
<br clear="all">
<img src="images/val_weekend/proposal_1824.jpg" alt=""><br>
It was my first time in a stretch limo too!&nbsp; The little colorful
specks of light, "fiber optic lights", change color all the time.<br>
<br>
<br>
<img src="images/val_weekend/proposal_1827.jpg" alt=""><br>
We arrived at Bryant Park Grill.&nbsp; I've been there once before and
knew the food was classy and healthy.&nbsp; I knew it would be perfect
for Aliona!&nbsp; She was in the mood for mimosas.&nbsp; I was in the
mood for a peach bellini.<br>
<br>
<br>
<img src="images/val_weekend/proposal_1833.jpg" alt=""><br>
Our food had arrived.&nbsp; I did like my lobster roll, but Aliona was
ecstatic about her potato pancake.<br>
<br>
<br>
<img src="images/val_weekend/proposal_1835.jpg" alt=""><br>
My months of planning this weekend was all paying off.<br>
<br>
<br>
<img src="images/val_weekend/proposal_1837.jpg" alt=""><br>
Here's a closer look at Aliona's salmon dish, topped with the potato
pancake and a wine sauce.<br>
<br>
<br>
<img src="images/val_weekend/proposal_1856.jpg" alt=""><br>
We got back into the limo and arrived at the Mandarin Oriental hotel on
the other (west) side of Central Park, at Columbus Circle.&nbsp; Here's
our view.<br>
<br>
<br>
<img src="images/val_weekend/proposal_1858.jpg" alt=""><br>
I wanted to let her escape from her hectic student life in a serene,
stylish setting.&nbsp; My jacket usually not this reflective, but the
camera's flash makes it seem so.<br>
<br>
<br>
<img src="images/val_weekend/proposal_1860.jpg" alt=""><br>
The hotel left us complimentary chocolate covered strawberries on a bed
of white chocolate shavings.&nbsp; I had already eaten two of them.<br>
<br>
<br>
<img src="images/val_weekend/proposal_1862.jpg" alt=""><br>
I had the hotel have flowers waiting for us, which we ended up taking
home.&nbsp; At the time of this writing, we are protecting them from
the jaws of kitten Luna.<br>
<br>
<br>
<img src="images/val_weekend/proposal_1865.jpg" alt=""><br>
There was a perfectly placed lounge chair alongside our room's window
which quickly became Aliona's favorite spot in the room.<br>
<br>
<br>
<img src="images/val_weekend/proposal_1868.jpg" alt=""><br>
Upon nightfall, we were immersed in the sparkling city lights.<br>
<br>
<br>
<img src="images/val_weekend/proposal_1875.jpg" alt=""><br>
This picture is after a lot happened.&nbsp; To sum it up, I brought
Aliona to Masa, one of the world's most expensive restaurants, and
during 27 courses of Japanese goodies, I had proposed to her with a 6
line speech that I had run through my head twenty times earlier that
day.&nbsp; Thankfully I remembered the right knee, and the Tiffany ring
fit her perfectly.&nbsp; Everyone applauded and the restaurant gave us
a complimentary dessert.&nbsp; Unfortunately, the shock killed Aliona's
appetite.<br>
<br>
<br>
<img src="images/val_weekend/ring.jpg" alt=""><br>
Here's a picture of the ring, by the way.<br>
<br>
<br>
<img src="images/val_weekend/proposal_1877.jpg" alt=""><br>
It was a multilayer cake made of green tea flavored crepe.&nbsp; We
thought the sake bottle candle was cute.<br>
<br>
<br>
<img src="images/val_weekend/proposal_1879.jpg" alt=""><br>
The staff took our picture behind the sushi bar.<br>
<br>
<br>
<img src="images/val_weekend/proposal_1882.jpg" alt=""><br>
I had went around New York looking for the perfect bottle of Rose
champagne and had the hotel have that and berries waiting for us upon
our return to the room.<br>
<br>
<br>
<img src="images/val_weekend/proposal_1883.jpg" alt=""><br>
Yes, I also went for the rose petals!&nbsp; Aliona thought the
perfectly aligned petals on the shelf was a bit OCD but was nonetheless
swept off her feet!<br>
<br>
<br>
<img src="images/val_weekend/proposal_1891.jpg" alt=""><br>
Aliona did not want to leave her favorite chair, but she wanted more
berries.<br>
<br>
<br>
<img src="images/val_weekend/proposal_1897.jpg" alt=""><br>
I passed her the bowl.<br>
<br>
<br>
<img src="images/val_weekend/proposal_1899.jpg" alt=""><br>
It was time for more champagne!<br>
<br>
<br>
<img src="images/val_weekend/proposal_1900.jpg" alt=""><br>
The camera was perfectly balanced on a champagne glass as I ran over to
be photographed for this magical moment.&nbsp; I knew it was magical
because I did not trip.<br>
<br>
<br>
<img src="images/val_weekend/proposal_1908.jpg" alt=""><br>
It seemed destiny to mix the berries and champagne.&nbsp; We thought
the strawberry looked a bit like Pacman, but I was also reminded of
Little Shop of Horrors.<br>
<br>
<br>
<img src="images/val_weekend/proposal_1911.jpg" alt=""><br>
The view in the morning was dreamy, with lazy clouds in the sky.<br>
<br>
<br>
<img src="images/val_weekend/proposal_1914.jpg" alt=""><br>
No matter what Aliona and I were up to, Columbus Circle was always
busy.&nbsp; Every so often, a horse and carraige would trot through and
traffic would slow to a crawl.<br>
<br>
<br>
<img src="images/val_weekend/proposal_1919.jpg" alt=""><br>
Thanks to CNN, we didn't need watches.<br>
<br>
<br>
<img src="images/val_weekend/proposal_1923.jpg" alt=""><br>
I dragged Aliona to a prix fixe brunch at the hotel the next
morning.&nbsp; We didn't have much choice, so I was forced to eat this
poultry for breakfast.<br>
<br>
<br>
<img src="images/val_weekend/proposal_1928.jpg" alt=""><br>
Aliona thought so much fancy food was getting a bit silly.<br>
<br>
<br>
<img src="images/val_weekend/proposal_1929.jpg" alt=""><br>
And on that note, more salmon and duck was served.<br>
<br>
<br>
<img src="images/val_weekend/proposal_1934.jpg" alt=""><br>
At this point, I was the only one still eating this chocolate raspberry
mousse cake and the best creme brulee ever, complete with almond cookie.<br>
<br>
<br>
<img src="images/val_weekend/heli.jpg" alt=""><br clear="all">
We finished up in plenty time to make it downtown for the helicopter
tour I reserved for us.&nbsp; It was meant to be a surprise, but Aliona
spied the word "helicopter" on some of the paperwork I was sifting
through.<br>
<br>
<br>
<img src="images/val_weekend/proposal_1949.jpg" alt=""><br>
Statue of Liberty waved hi to us.<br>
<br>
<br>
<img src="images/val_weekend/proposal_1955.jpg" alt=""><br>
Here's our pilot.&nbsp; We had headphones and mics, but it's awkward to
talk on them.&nbsp; The pilot tried to make conversation with us, but
we felt too awkward to say much back.&nbsp; Must be lonely for him, but
he gets to fly over New York all day without fighter pilots shooting at
him, so not too bad.<br>
<br>
<br>
<img src="images/val_weekend/proposal_1960.jpg" alt=""><br>
Look Mom, I'm in a helicopter.&nbsp; The last time I showed her a
picture like this, she got all nervous, thinking I joined the military.<br>
<br>
<br>
<img src="images/val_weekend/proposal_1968.jpg" alt=""><br>
The flight was very fun, but at this point, we started worrying about
nausea.&nbsp; The pilot was taking liberties with the how far the
helicopter would swing to the side when we turned.&nbsp; Here we flew
over the Cyclone at the Coney Island amusement park.<br>
<br>
<br>
<img src="images/val_weekend/proposal_1972.jpg" alt=""><br>
Boats are wrapped up during the icy winter.<br>
<br>
<br>
<img src="images/val_weekend/proposal_1982.jpg" alt=""><br>
Best picture ever of my favorite bridge, the Verrazano.<br>
<br>
<br>
<img src="images/val_weekend/proposal_1988.jpg" alt=""><br>
We saw a very freaky set of art exhibits on Governor's Island, shown
here, including one with hundreds of carefully photographed traffic
cones.<br>
<br>
<br>
<img src="images/val_weekend/proposal_1991.jpg" alt=""><br>
Here's downtown New York, where most of the world is profited off of.<br>
<br>
<br>
<img src="images/val_weekend/proposal_1993.jpg" alt=""><br>
The World Trade Center reconstruction is looking good.&nbsp; Both
Aliona and I missed out on the opportunity to see the twin towers, so
we'll be sure to fully appreciate this one.<br>
<br>
<br>
<img src="images/val_weekend/proposal_1997.jpg" alt=""><br>
The Empire State Building is right near the eye doctor in Koreatown
that Aliona and I go to.<br>
<br>
<br>
<img src="images/val_weekend/proposal_2000.jpg" alt=""><br>
Here's the piers around midtown west, including the Intrepid Sea, Air
and Space museum.<br>
<br>
<br>
<img src="images/val_weekend/proposal_2002.jpg" alt=""><br>
Flying northbound, we see the northern half of Central Park, with some
of Queens behind it.<br>
<br>
<br>
<img src="images/val_weekend/proposal_2017.jpg" alt=""><br>
The pilot made such a big deal of Skankee Stadium.&nbsp; Okay, I'll
take just one picture, but that's it.<br>
<br>
<br>
<img src="images/val_weekend/proposal_2020.jpg" alt=""><br>
As we swerved away from the stadium, these bridges lined up on what I
think is the Harlem River, so my camera took a picture.<br>
<br>
<br>
<img src="images/val_weekend/proposal_2024.jpg" alt=""><br>
Aliona took this delightful picture of the George Washington Bridge.<br>
<br>
<br>
<img src="images/val_weekend/proposal_2031.jpg" alt=""><br>
The tourists sitting across from us took this picture for us.&nbsp; We
were taking a lot of pictures for each other.&nbsp; It was a bonding
experience.<br>
<br>
<br>
<img src="images/val_weekend/proposal_2045.jpg" alt=""><br>
My last surprise was again not really a surprise, as Aliona had spent
all day interrogating me, finding out subtle details until she figured
out we were going on a dinner cruise.&nbsp; The Empire State Building
was lit blue and white.&nbsp; It was a sign from my mother who wants a
proper Jewish wedding.<br>
<br>
<br>
<img src="images/val_weekend/proposal_2050.jpg" alt=""><br>
With the platinum romance package, we had lovely window seats, roses,
and more champagne waiting for us at our table.&nbsp; Aliona used the
champagne to make more mimosas.<br>
<br>
<br>
<img src="images/val_weekend/proposal_2058.jpg" alt=""><br>
They announced our engagement to everyone on the cruise, and we got a
bunch of "oooos" and applause.<br>
<br>
<br>
<img src="images/val_weekend/proposal_2062.jpg" alt=""><br>
Here's a dimly lit shot at the others onboard, mostly celebrating
anniversaries and birthdays.<br>
<br>
<br>
<img src="images/val_weekend/proposal_2068.jpg" alt=""><br>
There was live music with some people dancing nearby.<br>
<br>
<br>
<img src="images/val_weekend/proposal_2070.jpg" alt=""><br>
It was pretty cold and windy outside, but we still wanted to go out and
take pictures.<br>
<br>
<br>
<img src="images/val_weekend/proposal_2089.jpg" alt=""><br>
Aliona spent the remainder of her stay outside putting on more
clothes.&nbsp; We were frolicking about and giggling, then decided to
finally go back in, just as the captain was rushing out, probably to
scold us for being silly.&nbsp; Since we were done, he sheepishly
turned right back around and said nothing.<br>
<br>
<br>
<img src="images/val_weekend/proposal_2094.jpg" alt=""><br>
More fancy food.&nbsp; We made sure to starve ourselves most of the day
so we could physically consume another prix fixe meal.&nbsp; During
this cruise, the realization that I had gone overboard with the fancy
food did not set in.&nbsp; It probably hit home the night before,
actually.&nbsp; I think I had some form of herb-roasted chicken while
Aliona had a salmon dish.<br>
<br>
<br>
<img src="images/val_weekend/proposal_2129.jpg" alt=""><br>
We floated by the Statue of Liberty and me, along with everyone else,
rushed out to take this stunning picture.<br>
<br>
<br>
<img src="images/val_weekend/proposal_2138.jpg" alt=""><br>
A photographer went around taking pictures of the couples on board and
showing them the photos, for sale, on an iPad.&nbsp; We didn't like our
photos too much, so we had our waitress take this one for free.<br>
<br>
<br>
<img src="images/val_weekend/proposal_2141.jpg" alt=""><br>
The singer visited our side of the boat near the end of the
cruise.&nbsp; Afterward, we raced off the ship and tried desperately to
find a cab outside Chelsea Piers.&nbsp; It turns out, it's very easy to
find one if you walk one avenue in, but we didn't figure that out until
frostbite set in.&nbsp; Aliona slept well that night and spent the next
day telling her overjoyed parents the news, then tried desperately to
get back to studying for an exam.<br>
