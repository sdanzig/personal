<p align="center">Here's something we found that was really awesome as we made 
our way to the English Garden in northeast Munich.&nbsp; This was a small river 
that went right through the garden, under a bridge, and through the city.&nbsp; 
It was probably about 55F, and there were surfers in wet suits taking turns 
surfing back and forth across the river.&nbsp; There was a place in the river 
that had a bit of a hump (water rushing over a bump on the river floor) and this 
simulated a wave well enough to surf on.&nbsp; It's a consistent wave too, so 
although perhaps less exciting, there's no waiting for the water and it's no 
doubt very good for practice.&nbsp; <a href="media/videos/107_0720.wmv">Here's a video</a> 
of it.</p>

<p align="center">Here's another wonderful shot of a surfer going over the 
rapids.&nbsp; This woman here seemed to be the best surfer out of the bunch, but 
I'm not sure, because she didn't attempt as many tricks as the others.&nbsp; But 
she seemed the most surefooted on her board.</p>

<p align="center">Here's a photo in the English Garden.&nbsp; You can see a 
little creature running across the grass, to the lower left.&nbsp; That is a red 
squirrel.&nbsp; Squirrels are not supposed to be red.&nbsp; They're gray!&nbsp; 
This squirrel begged to differ.</p>

<p align="center">Here's a little stone gazebo in the English Garden, mainly 
used for a nice view.</p>

<p align="center">This is in the Hofgarten to the northwest of Marienplatz.&nbsp; 
I saw a couple kissing in this picturesque gazebo and figured it was a Kodak 
moment.</p>
