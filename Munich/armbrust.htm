<p align="center">This is the first beer tent we went in.&nbsp; Not the most 
memorable name by American standards, but let me assure you, &quot;zelt&quot; means 
&quot;tent&quot;.</p>

<p align="center">Here's a good view of the inside of the beer tent.&nbsp; See 
the raised platform back there?&nbsp; That's where the musicians are.&nbsp; Fun 
drinking songs, all day long.&nbsp; <a href="media/videos/105_0560.wmv">Here's a 
video!</a></p>

<p align="center">To the left, apple fritters, and to the right, an onion bread 
of some sort.&nbsp; When Leigh and I tried those apple fritters, it proved to be 
a very good omen about German food.&nbsp; Oh god, they were so good.&nbsp; 
Sooooooooooo goooooooooood.&nbsp; Mmmmmmmmmmmmm.&nbsp; Anyway...</p>

<p align="center">I was thinking of removing this picture, but I liked the shot 
of a drinker going through his wallet.&nbsp; Look at the desperation and 
financial ruin in his eyes as he realizes how much that liter of beer just cost 
him.&nbsp; However, that look will go away after he drinks the liter.</p>

<p align="center">This waitress demonstrates what I found to be an amazing 
talent.&nbsp; Look at all them heavy beer glasses.&nbsp; They can carry around 
more than that too.&nbsp; She holds only 6, but we've seen them do up to 10 per 
hand.&nbsp; Isn't this a nice picture though?</p>

<p align="center">Here is the most attractive girl I remember in Munich.&nbsp; 
Maybe it's the pigtails.&nbsp; I bought one of those gray hats from her, and she 
put it on my head for me.&nbsp; It doesn't fit though.</p>

it.</p>
