<p align="center">So here we're off to see the Neuschwanstein Castle and the 
Linderhof Palace, both built for Ludwig II.&nbsp; I was anxious to get some nice 
shots of the Bavarian Alps while the tour bus took us out there.&nbsp; I was 
also anxious to figure out how to get my camera to take pictures while moving on 
the Autobahn, through the glass windows.&nbsp; I figure I did a decent job 
considering.</p>

<p align="center">Here's another shot of little houses at the foothills of the 
Bavarian Alps.</p>

<p align="center">We reached the Linderhof Palace.&nbsp; I've seen the 
Buckingham Palace, and this was far smaller.&nbsp; It's even much smaller than 
your average Rhode Island mansion.&nbsp; Tons smaller.&nbsp; However, it was 
still bigger than any house I'm going to own any time soon, and it was very well 
decorated.&nbsp; Especially with things that translated to &quot;I am the greatest.&quot;&nbsp; 
Good ol' Ludwig.</p>

<p align="center">Here's one of the decorations.&nbsp; Normally there's a 
fountain that shoots up pretty high, but it's off right now.&nbsp; But doesn't 
that gazebo look nice?</p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center">

<p align="center">Witness lots of gold-plated stuff all throughout the palace.&nbsp; 
Mind you, there's less gold than you might think.&nbsp; Only 5 kilograms of gold 
was used for the whole palace, so it was painted on pretty thin.</p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center">

<p align="center">This table was the one-man dining room.&nbsp; It actually 
lowered through the floor.&nbsp; Then the chefs would put a gourmet meal on it 
and raise it back up for Ludwig to eat off of.</p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center">
<img border="0" src="media/castle%20tour/s_107_0790.jpg" width="600" height="800"></p>
<p align="center">This was the most expensive thing in the palace.&nbsp; This 
chandelier is made of ivory.</p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center">
<img border="0" src="media/castle%20tour/s_107_0792.jpg" width="768" height="1024"></p>
<p align="center">This looked far more impressive than the picture shows.&nbsp; 
Those steps that lead up to the gazebo actually have water flowing over them.&nbsp; 
It was very impressive.</p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center">
<img border="0" src="media/castle%20tour/s_107_0795.jpg" width="768" height="1024"></p>
<p align="center">So then we went off to a town called Oberammergau.&nbsp; The 
town gets tourism business for not only being near the castles, but also for a 
play they perform about Jesus Christ.&nbsp; Something I found interesting was 
the cross I saw all the way at the top of that mountain in the background.&nbsp; 
It's a bit fuzzy but you can make it out.&nbsp; It's most likely not a telephone 
pole.</p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center">
<img border="0" src="media/castle%20tour/s_108_0806.jpg" width="800" height="600"></p>
<p align="center">Here's the one shot I got of the outside of the Neuschwanstein 
castle.&nbsp; It's very unflattering from this angle and distance, but that's it 
right there.&nbsp; If you want to see the castle in all its glory, get an aerial 
shot of the castle, such as <a href="http://www.germanworld.com/neu.htm">this</a>.</p>

<p align="center">
<img border="0" src="media/castle%20tour/s_108_0808.jpg" width="1024" height="768"></p>
<p align="center">Here's a view looking outwards from inside the castle.&nbsp; 
Not bad, huh?&nbsp; We weren't allowed to take pictures of the inside of the 
castle.</p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center">
<img border="0" src="media/castle%20tour/s_108_0810.jpg" width="640" height="480"></p>
<p align="center">But I took this one anyway.&nbsp; Could've did better, but I 
didn't want to get thrown out.</p>
