<p align="center">There were lots of cool looking crystals in the mineralogy 
museum we visited.&nbsp; There was also a decent lot, all in German, about earth 
science and about crystal growing.&nbsp; All the explanations were in German.&nbsp; 
But it was cheap though, and the exhibits were pretty.&nbsp; I managed to figure 
out some things though.&nbsp; I believe this is a replica of an early crystal 
synthesizer.&nbsp; Could be wrong, but I see it produces those slender rocks on 
the bottom, which reminds me of one of those playdough toys where you press a 
handle down and make clay french fries.</p>

<p align="center">Here's a crystal growing exhibit.&nbsp; See crystals in liquid 
suspended from strings.&nbsp; I know nothing more about this because it's all in 
friggin' German.</p>

<p align="center">This is the coolest looking rock I saw in the museum.&nbsp; It 
looks like a metallic blob of some sort.</p>
