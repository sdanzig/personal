<p align="center">And here we ran across the Deutsches Museum.&nbsp; About half 
the exhibits in this museum had English translations next to them.&nbsp; Woohoo!&nbsp; 
The Deutsches Museum is one of the better known museums in Germany, and it has 
exhibits about various subjects such as boats, as shown above, airplanes, 
astronomy, engineering, mining, pharmaceuticals, mathematics, computers, music, 
and a few others.</p>

<p align="center">So this was a fun and spacious exhibit of old German 
aircrafts.&nbsp; See the &quot;no touching&quot; sign on the bottom?&nbsp; I ignored that 
and touched the airplane.&nbsp; This aircraft seemed small, and it felt light, 
but what was surprising was that the larger airplane behind it felt pretty light 
too.&nbsp; You can pretty easily shake the plane up and down by its wing.&nbsp; 
It may seem like no big deal, but trust me, the planes felt a lot lighter than 
you'd think metal plated vehicles could be.</p>

<p align="center">This was part of the mining exhibit.&nbsp; Bavaria has a 
prominent salt mine, so it's a part of their history.&nbsp; Notice these people 
in the picture are all fake (I hope).&nbsp; At a quick glance though, they look 
like ninjas, don't they?</p>

<p align="center">Here's one of the many tunnels we made our way through in the 
mining exhibit.&nbsp; We were about to leave the museum but saw the entrance to 
the mining exhibit along the way.&nbsp; It took us 45 minutes to make our way 
out.&nbsp; It was a rather lengthy exhibit.&nbsp; They're quite proud of their 
mining industry.&nbsp; We aren't, however, because all the signs in the mining 
exhibit were only in German.</p>
