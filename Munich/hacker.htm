<p align="center">There were two beers I was looking for in Munich.&nbsp; One 
was Paulaner, and here was the flagship beer tent of the other, Hacker Pschorr.&nbsp; 
I believe Hacker Pschorr owns Paulaner though, but after enough beer, no one 
really cares.</p>

<p align="center">Here was the entertainment in the beer tent.&nbsp; These guys 
are the best drinking song musicians in the entire world.&nbsp; That's what ran 
through my head after the first two liters of beer.</p>

<p align="center">Check this out.&nbsp; The beer tent is designed so you can't 
tell whether you're inside or outside.&nbsp; In fact, I see both a blue, cloudy 
sky, and the night stars, so you don't know the time of day either.&nbsp; Then 
again, after the first few beers, pink polka dots would work too.&nbsp; Note 
that the one in the lower right is not a Bavarian, because I'm sure they could 
care less about the Chicago Cubs.</p>

<p align="center">I love this picture.&nbsp; This pretty much encapsulates how 
Leigh and I felt throughout most of the trip.&nbsp; We sit at a table with 
considerably older people.&nbsp; None of them could speak English.&nbsp; They 
didn't know this at first, but after a while, it didn't matter.&nbsp; We 
communicated in the language of beer.&nbsp; It was beautiful.&nbsp; And these 
are Bavarians, so they had a thing or two to teach us.&nbsp; First off, they 
called me a fool for drinking too fast.&nbsp; You'll see how things turned out 
later in this page.&nbsp; But anyway, they showed us the Bavarian ritual of 
toasting.&nbsp; One guy raises his mug, and then everyone else at the table, no 
matter age, gender, or size, raises their mugs and toasts everyone else.&nbsp; 
After that, you bang your mug down on the table, and then take a drink.&nbsp; I 
eventually abused our friends here, and had them performing this ritual every 30 
seconds for a good hour.&nbsp; It makes a good drinking game.&nbsp;
<a href="media/videos/106_0676.wmv">Here's a video</a> of Leigh getting along with our 
Bavarian friends.&nbsp; And <a href="media/videos/106_0677.wmv">here's another video</a> 
of the same thing, except with a drunken Plato rambling in the background about 
Leigh being his girlfriend.</p>

<p align="center">Here's some wonderful food we had at the beer tent.&nbsp; The 
top is something Leigh fell in love with.&nbsp; It's a thick n' creamy mushroom 
onion soup poured over a massive dumpling.&nbsp; That dumpling is almost like a 
matzah ball, except it's denser, and both its texture and taste is different.</p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>

<p align="center">Here's another picture of the crowd in the tent.&nbsp; You see 
a few people standing up, and that guy in the back is shouting something.&nbsp; 
People shouted things around the tent once in a while, often related to European 
soccer and rugby teams.</p>

<p align="center">Here's the bastard himself, our friend Plato.&nbsp; You'll see 
why I think of him as a scoundrel in later pictures, but he was very helpful.&nbsp; 
Plato, pronounced &quot;plah-toe&quot;, was born n' raised in Munich.&nbsp; He's 100% 
Bavarian.&nbsp; He speaks very good English and helped us translate what our 
German tablemates were saying, plus what was on the menu.</p>

<p align="center">Here's a picture of Leigh taking pictures.&nbsp; She has a 
wonderful smile here.&nbsp; See the bottom of the picture to see why.</p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>

<img border="0" src="media/oktoberfest/beer%20tents/hacker/s_106_0686.jpg" width="640" height="480"></p>
<p align="center">Here is me smiling, because of the beer, of course.&nbsp; 
Notice how cool my hat looks, along with the authentic Bavarian feather.</p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center">
<img border="0" src="media/oktoberfest/beer%20tents/hacker/s_106_0691.jpg" width="600" height="800"></p>
<p align="center">Now things are getting interesting.&nbsp; Leigh sits down at a 
neighboring table.&nbsp; I tend to think she knew someone was already sitting 
there.</p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center">
<img border="0" src="media/oktoberfest/beer%20tents/hacker/s_106_0692.jpg" width="640" height="480"></p>
<p align="center">Here's Leigh wanting no part of other women.&nbsp; We get it.</p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center">
<img border="0" src="media/oktoberfest/beer%20tents/hacker/s_106_0697.jpg" width="640" height="480"></p>
<p align="center">I, however, am a different story.</p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center">
<img border="0" src="media/oktoberfest/beer%20tents/hacker/s_106_0698.jpg" width="640" height="480"></p>
<p align="center">People compared how much beer they drank pretty often.&nbsp; 
Beer volume dynamics is a science studied throughout Bavaria, or at least 
throughout Oktoberfest.</p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center">
<img border="0" src="media/oktoberfest/beer%20tents/hacker/s_106_0700.jpg" width="640" height="480"></p>
<p align="center">Leigh and the one occupying her seat are eyed jealously by the 
evil Plato.</p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center">
<img border="0" src="media/oktoberfest/beer%20tents/hacker/s_107_0703.jpg" width="480" height="640"></p>
<p align="center">These chocolate hearts, as you can see held by the guy in this 
picture, were passed around often in the festival, showing adoration between 
both friends and strangers.&nbsp; One of the Germans we sat next to gave a big 
chocolate heart to Leigh, and she was touched.&nbsp; So I picked up a heart for 
her to give back, but.. I ended up getting one much smaller without realizing 
it.&nbsp; Oops.&nbsp; I chose the one I bought because it had the cutest little 
stuffed puppy attached to it.</p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center">
<img border="0" src="media/oktoberfest/beer%20tents/hacker/s_107_0706.jpg" width="800" height="600"></p>
<p align="center">Look at the new hat Plato just got.&nbsp; Looks good on him, 
doesn't it?&nbsp; Obviously, he thought so.&nbsp; It's a nice picture though.&nbsp; 
I like the nervous expression of that girl behind Leigh.</p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center">
<img border="0" src="media/oktoberfest/beer%20tents/hacker/s_107_0710.jpg" width="480" height="640"></p>
<p align="center">Alright, this is the first of four.&nbsp; Four what, you may 
ask?&nbsp; Four pictures that I do not remember taking.&nbsp; The story from 
Leigh was that people got up on tables and started dancing.&nbsp; Looks like 
fun.&nbsp; I can't tell you much more about this...</p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center">
<img border="0" src="media/oktoberfest/beer%20tents/hacker/s_107_0711.jpg" width="600" height="800"></p>
<p align="center">...or this.&nbsp; That girl on the left is cute though.</p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center">
<img border="0" src="media/oktoberfest/beer%20tents/hacker/s_107_0712.jpg" width="640" height="480"></p>
<p align="center">I know what's going on here quite well.&nbsp; It's that thing 
frat boys do when one of their buddies flops over drunk.&nbsp; I'm being mocked.&nbsp; 
I don't appreciate this one bit.&nbsp; No one stepped on my camera though, and 
for that, I am grateful.</p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center">
<img border="0" src="media/oktoberfest/beer%20tents/hacker/s_107_0714.jpg" width="480" height="640"></p>
<p align="center">I think this is the last picture taken by your hero before it 
was time for a nap.&nbsp; I won't discuss too much of what happened later.&nbsp; 
We did meet up with a soccer team from Amsterdam later, back at Marienplatz.&nbsp; 
We saw them mocking another team in the beer tent, so it was fun to chat with 
them.&nbsp; They tried to convince me to go to Amsterdam, saying it was a fun 
party town, and had more than an infamous red light district.</p>
