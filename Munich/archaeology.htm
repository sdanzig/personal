<p align="center">Near the English Garden, we found the Archaeology Museum.&nbsp; 
It was under heavy renovation, but it was only 1.5 euros each, so we went for 
it.&nbsp; Everything was in German.&nbsp; We barely understood even the years 
artifacts were dated as.&nbsp; Eventually I managed to decipher B.C. and A.D. in 
German, so it was slightly more than eye-candy after that.</p>

<p align="center">Here's a picture of some artist helping with the museum 
renovation.&nbsp; He did not appreciate me hanging over him taking his picture.</p>

<p align="center">Here's a curious display.&nbsp; They look like those things 
used to hold hair back.&nbsp; Then again, maybe it was some form of iron pasta.</p>

<p align="center">Coolest exhibit right here.&nbsp; I think this is real.&nbsp; 
What you see on the left is actual braided human hair.&nbsp; I think this is a 
fossilized head and torso.&nbsp; However, it could be completely fake.&nbsp; 
Awfully morbid recreation though, if it was fake.</p>
