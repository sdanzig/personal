<p align="center">We finally found Oktoberfest!&nbsp; I was jumping up and down 
excitedly, and little frothy mugs of beer with wings were fluttering before my 
eyes.&nbsp; Well, we didn't have to translate Oktoberfest, but you can look at 
the sign and see how Leigh and I learned a decent number of German words.&nbsp; 
Willkommen zum, given a couple seconds of thought, obviously means &quot;Welcome to&quot;.&nbsp; 
There are fun aspects to trying to decipher a language.&nbsp; At least one like 
German.&nbsp; It's like trying to solve a New York Times crossword puzzle!&nbsp; 
However, if the characters were different, like in Chinese, Hindi, or Arabic, we 
would have had no chance.</p>

<p align="center">A picture of Leigh at Oktoberfest.&nbsp; We were there during 
the later part of Oktoberfest, and it was the middle of the day, so perhaps 
that's why it wasn't TOO crowded, as you see.&nbsp; Anyway, on the far right, 
you see a man who apparently forgot to shave.&nbsp; I hate it when that happens.</p>

<p align="center">This is one scary Oktoberfest something.&nbsp; Is it a haunted 
house?&nbsp; Or a little ride of some sort?&nbsp; I don't know, but I love the 
little red devil that's holding up the open-mouthed skull of Waldo.&nbsp; Try to 
find it!</p>

<p align="center">What is the Hippodrom?&nbsp; Maybe we should have taken a 
look.&nbsp; It looked dazzling enough to take a picture, but we really were only 
there for the beer.</p>

<p align="center">See in the distance there's a gigantic rotating beer.&nbsp; 
Well, a fake one, but I saw it advertising Paulaner, my favorite German beer, so 
I was quite happy to see it.&nbsp; Closer picture later.</p>

<p align="center">They sold huge pretzels for 3 euros each all over Oktoberfest.&nbsp; 
A euro, mind you, turned out to be worth a buck and a quarter.&nbsp; The 
pretzels were a necessity, it turns out, to soak up the liters of beer they were 
peddling.</p>

<p align="center">Lots of the things around Oktoberfest had festive statues.&nbsp; 
Here are a few of them that seem to get along well.</p>

<p align="center">This statue was friggin huge, and bright orange.&nbsp; It was 
like.. 4 people high!</p>

<p align="center">This is a guy at the Oktoberfest entrance who just turned a 
crank all day, making music.&nbsp; I took his picture.&nbsp; He wanted money.&nbsp; 
I gave him money, and he thanked me swiftly.&nbsp; Music box man, the epitome of 
German efficiency.</p>

<p align="center">I was drunk at the time I took this picture of the German 
police at Oktoberfest.&nbsp; The police only had a problem with you if you were 
sober, so I was fine.</p>
