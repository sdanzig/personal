<p align="center">Ah, the glorious Hofbr<font face="Times New Roman">äuhaus, the 
Mecca of all beer drinking tourists.&nbsp; We rounded a corner at night and 
found it.&nbsp; You can see it on the left side of the road a couple buildings 
down.&nbsp; You can see in blue, illuminated lettering the word </font>&quot;Hofbr<font face="Times New Roman">äuhaus&quot;, 
although it may be too fuzzy in this picture.&nbsp; Just before it is the Hard 
Rock Cafe, marked by that really bright sign in front of it.&nbsp; We went to 
the Hard Rock Cafe as well, and learned that the local German cuisine was so 
much healthier than the Americanized deep-fried stuff they sold there.&nbsp; 
Anyway, on to the </font>Hofbr<font face="Times New Roman">äuhaus!</font></p>

<p align="center">So in the Hofbr<font face="Times New Roman">äuhaus, we met 
plenty of tourists.&nbsp; I don't know where the two in the back are from, but 
the two in the front are from Wisconsin.&nbsp; They sound like they're from the 
movie Fargo, which makes geographical sense.&nbsp; We made plans later to meet 
up with the Wisconsin-fok at Oktoberfest the next day, but they were a no-show.</font></p>

<p align="center">Here's a view of the Hofbr<font face="Times New Roman">äuhaus.&nbsp; 
Things seem a bit tame right now, but they liven up as the day goes on.&nbsp; 
Just like the beer tents in Oktoberfest, there are constant drinking songs being 
sung.&nbsp; The </font>Hofbr<font face="Times New Roman">äuhaus has a band that 
plays drinking songs too, including one that's all about the </font>Hofbr<font face="Times New Roman">äuhaus.</font></p>

<img border="0" src="media/hofbrauhaus/s_106_0643.jpg" width="640" height="480"></p>
<p align="center">You can see what appears to be a girl and her father or 
grandpa dancing up and down the Hofbr<font face="Times New Roman">äuhaus floor.&nbsp;
<a href="media/videos/106_0649.wmv">Here's a video</a> of some music being played 
while this pair is still going at it.&nbsp; I have a duel with another guy 
holding a video camera who gets in my way far too much.&nbsp; You'll find him 
annoying just like I did.</font></p>

<p align="center">Hmm.. grandpa probably.&nbsp; Anyway, see in the lower left, 
here are two of the three guys were originally sat down with.&nbsp; I think the 
one on the left is Czech and the one in orange is German, but I could be wrong.</p>

<p align="center">
<img border="0" src="media/hofbrauhaus/s_106_0645.jpg" width="640" height="480"></p>
<p align="center">One thing's for certain.&nbsp; The one drinking the beer on 
the left is French.</p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center">

<p align="center">Some girl who seemed trashed standing up on a table.</p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center">
<img border="0" src="media/hofbrauhaus/s_106_0647.jpg" width="800" height="600"></p>
<p align="center">The lady on the right has the most shit-faced expression I've 
ever seen.&nbsp; See the guys in the back having a toast to something.</p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center">
<img border="0" src="media/hofbrauhaus/s_106_0648.jpg" width="640" height="480"></p>
<p align="center">Meet Mary and Sue, on the bottom left and right.&nbsp; These 
girls were from North Carolina, taking the seats of the Wisconsin folk after 
they left.&nbsp; We made plans to meet up with these two also, along with the 
Wisconsin guys.&nbsp; We didn't make it in time to meet up with these two.&nbsp; 
Oh well.</p>

<img border="0" src="media/hofbrauhaus/s_106_0655.jpg" width="640" height="480"></p>
<p align="center">Tourists took their beer seriously at the Hofbr<font face="Times New Roman">äuhaus.</font></p>

<p align="center">Here's the French dude in one of them pointy hats.&nbsp; 
Despite the world's politics at the moment, how can you hate someone who looks 
so darn goofy?&nbsp; <a href="media/videos/106_0650.wmv">Here's a video</a> of Leigh 
and the French dude.</p>
