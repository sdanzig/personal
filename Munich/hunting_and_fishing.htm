<p align="center">Here's a statue of the wild boar in front of the hunting and 
fishing museum.&nbsp; On the other side of the entrance is a fish.&nbsp; Catfish 
maybe?&nbsp; Anyway, we passed by these statues a number of times without 
realizing what they were for.&nbsp; Apparently, it's simply not obvious to us, 
nor a number of tourists we talked to, despite what they're statues of.</p>

<p align="center">Here's an interesting German creature brought to the museum by 
the finest taxidermists in all of Bavaria.&nbsp; Because the signs were all in 
German, we don't know if its extinct or not.</p>

<p align="center">These stuff boars just looked cute.&nbsp; Especially the one 
on the right.</p>

<p align="center">And these things looked cuter.&nbsp; That's about all we could 
say about any of the exhibits, because all the signs were in German.</p>

<p align="center">Well, except these.&nbsp; These many many hunting rifles 
looked very festive and deadly.&nbsp; There was one gun that seemed about 9 feet 
long.&nbsp; A bit excessive to need a gun barrel that you can rest on your 
target's nose.</p>
