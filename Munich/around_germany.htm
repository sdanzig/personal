<p align="center">Leigh and I in the German rental car on Autobahn 92 heading 
towards Munich from the airport.&nbsp; It took us a while to learn how to set 
the car in automatic transmission mode.&nbsp; The car manual, just like all the 
street signs, were not in English.</p>

<p align="center">Here's the inside of the S-Train which goes around Munich, to 
the airport, and elsewhere.&nbsp; There were also the subways, or Underground 
trains, represented by U's, which allowed easier transportation within Munich.&nbsp; 
Both rode about as smooth as the above-ground trains in the US, as opposed to 
NYC subways.</p>

<p align="center">Here's a tacky example of one of the many &quot;smart cars&quot; in 
Germany.&nbsp; These things can park absolutely anywhere, and since there are 
barely any large cars in Munich (no SUVs), they're probably relatively safe too.</p>

<p align="center">Here's a weary, off-duty waitress returning home after a 
hectic day at Oktoberfest.&nbsp; So I blasted her with my camera flash.</p>

<p align="center">These bikes seemed popular in Munich.&nbsp; A bunch of guys 
(seems like 7) sit on a seat and pedal.&nbsp; I figure one of them has to be 
steering.&nbsp; Munich had rather clean air and no traffic jams because of 
inventions like this.&nbsp; They have bike lanes along every road alongside the 
sidewalks.&nbsp; There were very stylish bikes, scooters, and we even saw one of 
those Segway things.&nbsp; With all these alternatives to cars, it's no wonder 
that everyone we saw in Munich -- everyone -- was skinny.</p>

<p align="center">This building was the main Munich judicial building, as far as 
we could tell.&nbsp; The fountain in front is the supposedly well-known Neptune 
Fountain which we found turns on at about 7:45AM.&nbsp; The buses in front are 
where many tours start from.&nbsp; You can either buy a ticket in advance, or, 
if you didn't know better (like me) you can buy your ticket at the bus, as long 
as you talk to the guy in charge.&nbsp; There were extra &quot;entrance fees&quot; in 
addition to the tour fees, which we thought were included.&nbsp; Don't stay 
attached to your money.</p>

<p align="center">This pissed me off.&nbsp; We go into a restaurant owned by 
Paulaner.&nbsp; I love the beer.&nbsp; However, I wanted my adorable little 
mouse-sundae.&nbsp; LOOK WHAT THEY GAVE ME!&nbsp; WTF is THAT?!&nbsp; Well, at 
least it tasted good.&nbsp; The ice cream was strawberry in the back and a 
bourbon-vanilla in front.</p>

<p align="center">These guys were sooooooooooooo drunk.&nbsp; They come up to us 
asking if we've seen any k-nomes.&nbsp; We look at each other and shrug.&nbsp; 
They repeat &quot;kuh-nomes&quot; or whatever.&nbsp; They clarify &quot;You know, short 
people?&quot;&nbsp; I reply, &quot;Ah! Gnomes!&quot; Their eyes light up, &quot;Yeah! Gnomes!&quot;&nbsp; 
Leigh adds, &quot;You mean like pink elephants?&quot;&nbsp; &quot;Exactly!&quot;&nbsp; I was amused, 
so I had them pose in the middle of a busy intersection at night for a picture.</p>

<p align="center">This is the word for &quot;Exit&quot; that we saw in the parking 
garages.&nbsp; Hey, we're from Jersey.&nbsp; It amused us.</p>
