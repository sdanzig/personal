<h2>View of My House and Car in Howell, NJ</h2>
<img src='images/house/house_and_car.jpg'><br>
Heres my townhouse, with my car too.  To be explicit, I own the quarter of the building facing you.  On the mostly front-facing wall, the sliding glass doors and the three right-most windows are part of my house.  On the side wall, the left-top window and the left-most front door are mine.
</p>
<br>
<br>
<p>
<h2>The Foyer</h2>
<img src='images/house/foyer.jpg'><br>
See my Mets and Devils baseball caps hanging on the banister to the left.  On the right, you can see my running sneakers, distinguishable by the safety material that reflects the flash pretty well.
</p>
<br>
<br>
<p>
<h2>The Great Room</h2>
<img src='images/house/great_room-pic1.jpg'><br>
Heres the great room, which you see if you walk in the house and turn left.  Im proud of my leather sofa, and had no idea that the chaise lounge could be so wonderful.  It is.   On the back wall, I hung a dartboard, complete with a 8 by 4 foot protective backboard.  On the coffee table, I have a bowl of candy, and the latest issue of the many free magazine subscriptions I get.  The table for dining is in the back.<br>
<br>
<br>
<img src='images/house/great_room-pic2.jpg'><br>
Heres the front view of my great room.  On the left is my 36 inch TV which seems plenty good enough until HDTV is reasonably priced.  My gas fireplace is in the center, decorated with trinkets from other countries.  My wine rack is on the right, which you cant see too well here.
</p>
<br>
<br>
<p>
<h2>The Kitchen</h2>
<img src='images/house/kitchen-pic1.jpg'><br>
Heres a view of the kitchen, with things like a mini-TV, a spice rack, toaster oven, waffle maker, large cutting board, etc etc.  The great thing about the kitchen is the breakfast bar that opens up to the great room.  Not only good for serving food and drinks, but also as handy counter space when cooking.<br>
<br>
<br>
<img src='images/house/kitchen-pic2.jpg'><br>
This is the rest of my kitchen.  Not much else to say here.  Trashcan on the right is for recycling.
</p>
<br>

<h2>The First Floor Bathroom</h2>
<img src='images/house/first_floor_bathroom.jpg'><br>
This half-bathroom has proven to be a godsend for stair-haters.
</p>
<br>
<br>
<p>
<h2>The Washer/Dryer Area</h2>
<img src='images/house/washer_and_dryer.jpg'><br>
Heres the washer and dryer you see once you walk up to the second floor.<br>
<br>
<br>
<img src='images/house/downstairs_lower.jpg'><br>
And heres the view of the stairs leading back down.
</p>
<br>
<br>
<p>
<h2>The Main Bathroom</h2>
<img src='images/house/main_bathroom.jpg'><br>
This is the second floor bathroom that whoevers in the guest room would use, and also is the quickest to get to from the loft.  I had this floor retiled, so I made sure to show it here.
</p>
<br>
<br>
<p>
<h2>The Bedroom Hallway</h2>
<img src='images/house/bedroom_hallway.jpg'><br>
Heres the hallway leading to the rooms on the second floor.  This is a view looking out of the guest room.  On the far wall is the main bathroom, and on the left is the master bedroom.
</p>
<br>
<br>
<p>
<h2>The Master Bedroom</h2>
<img src='images/house/master_bedroom-pic1.jpg'><br>
This is my master bedroom, complete with my monstrous bed.  Yep, I appreciate every inch of thickness.  I have a little TV on top of the chest, and I figured this was a decent place to put the recliner.  The black thing on the pillow covers my eyes when I sleep late.<br>
<br>
<br>
<img src='images/house/master_bedroom-pic2.jpg'><br>
See, the recliner has a bookcase next to it, and I can sit on the recliner when putting my socks on.  Its not easy to put socks on when sitting on a bed with an 18 inch thick mattress.  You can see some of my closet space.  I have a pretty decent amount of it for a bedroom.  On the right of the photo is the door leading to the master bathroom.
</p>
<br>
<br>
<p>
<h2>The Master Bathroom</h2>
<img src='images/house/master_bathroom.jpg'><br>
Thanks to the mirror, I managed to capture most of it in one photo.  I also had this room retiled, and with the double vanity and separate shower stall and soaking tub, Im quite proud of this bathroom.
</p>
<br>
<br>
<p>
<h2>The Guest Room</h2>
<img src='images/house/guest_room-pic1.jpg'><br>
Fear not, the contraption to the right is where Im growing primarily basil.  As the leaves fall off, I store them in jars, and it smells divine.  My bonsai tree is in there too.  Ill find a better place for both eventually.  The color of this room is called afterglow.  The room was originally canary yellow, which was too cheerful for me, but I still liked how the room captured the sun.  This color was a happy compromise.<br>
<br>
<br>
<img src='images/house/guest_room-pic2.jpg'><br>
More closet space in the guest room.
</p>
<br>
<br>
<p>
<h2>The Loft</h2>
<img src='images/house/loft-pic1.jpg'><br>
Heres my loft, more functional than pretty.  I have my computer desk there, my treadmill, and my TV.  The ball is one of those Flexballs good for working out.  The shelves on the walls are great for random storage of things that shouldnt be buried in a closet, but dont get used often or are out of season.<br>
<br>
<br>
<img src='images/house/loft-pic2.jpg'><br>
Heres the view of the stairwell leading up to the loft.  This is where the old sofa got moved to, and I have a mini-fridge, mostly used to store water, soda, and beer on the third floor.  Heat rises, so the two ceiling fans and window help in the summer.
