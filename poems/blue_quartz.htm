<p align="left"><font size="5">Blue Quartz</font></p>

<p align="left">As the trees entrench the air in summer's sensations,<br>
The golden sun rises over the dew-dripping leaves,<br>
And the slight waves of water swirl around the slickened stones,<br>
In slender creeks which curl around the glistening glades.<br>
<br>
And the leaves leave the trees in vibrant veils,<br>
Of orioles that flutter, canaries that sing,<br>
And cardinals that frolick and fall,<br>
Sheathing the autumn earth in their fiery splendor.<br>
<br>
A sun-lit rose sways over the snowy swards,<br>
And light pours down through its sanguine petals,<br>
Onto the angelic alabaster ground, gracefully blushing,<br>
Smoothed by a blanket of gentle fervor.<br>
<br>
Ducks float past dazzling flashes from heaven's mirror,<br>
Bordered by lazy spring lilies and lichened logs,<br>
Speckled luxuriously with the sunken sparkles,<br>
From the crystalline treasures beneath its glass.</p>
