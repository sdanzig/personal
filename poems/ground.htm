<p align="left"><font size="5">Holy Ground Ritual</font></p>

<p align="left">With peace in our lives and love in her light,<br>
We trod throughout the troubled trails to try,<br>
To strengthen the goodwill of her gift, life,<br>
To set the path of endless death awry.<br>
May her loved divinity grace this ground,<br>
May her magic thrive from her precious earth,<br>
May her coveted shine embrace, around<br>
This slice of the world she gave life and mirth.<br>
Let the sky's majesty see far below,<br>
Her endless kindness, which we strive to show,<br>
Empowering our magic with her serene soul,<br>
With her sacred blessings, our magic flows.<br>
Her holiness and light is now unbound,<br>
All need not fear, for this is holy ground! </p>
