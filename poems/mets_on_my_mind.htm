<p align="left">The Mets on my mind,<br>
Daydreaming of the day when 'eros emerged.<br>
A lineup to love,<br>
A rotation to revere.<br>
<br>
A mound with muskets of marksmen,<br>
Firing balls elusive as an escaping mouse,<br>
Which prance like pebbles in a rockslide.<br>
Batters sedated by darts from Pedro's blowgun.<br>
<br>
Fly balls turn to breadcrumbs,<br>
In a field freckled by a flock of sparrows.<br>
With Doug wielding the glove of La Brea,<br>
Ground balls are slain by knights guarding their king.<br>
<br>
And the knights charge the bases...<br>
<br>
Like litter in a hurricane,<br>
Ricocheting off bases like bent lasers.<br>
Jose becomes a hungry fox,<br>
Hunting the hare at home.<br>
<br>
The strongest champions accept their challenge.<br>
Carlos, composing a constellation of frozen ropes.<br>
Cliff, sending a warning shot to Icarus.<br>
Mike Piazza, harpooning a god.<br>
<br>
Enthralled by enthusiasm,<br>
As each battle begins.<br>
The Mets on my mind,<br>
The days have been kind. </p>
