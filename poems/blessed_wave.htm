<p align="left"><font size="5">Blessed Wave</font></p>

<p align="left">Sleeping windows under summer's windflow,<br>
Taillights flare and glare before a linkless<br>
train which snakes, no breaks, an endless sequence,<br>
Fangs enraged beneath a flaming afro!<br>
<br>
Spirit lost, a blacktop purgatory,<br>
Shadowed eyes with glints of laughter,<br>
Asshole makes my drive a huge disaster,<br>
Any longer be extremely gory!<br>
<br>
Billowed steam as fists go tight and knuckles<br>
white and grating teeth of thund'ring anger,<br>
Wait for inf'nite wanker after wanker,<br>
Pedal floored when traffic fin'ly buckles.<br>
<br>
Sleeping windows under summer's windflow,<br>
Taillights flare and glare before a linkless<br>
train which snakes, no breaks, an endless sequence,<br>
Snake is sliced and hand is waved -- my hero.<br>
<br>
Spirit lost, a blacktop purgatory,<br>
Eyes of mercy, softened, show compassion,<br>
With resolve to stop--so daring, dashing,<br>
Stopping seemed to be obligatory.<br>
<br>
Darkened clouds divide for streaming sunshine,<br>
Such serene a smile past the stop sign. </p>
