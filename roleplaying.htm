Mystic Realms</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="4" color="#008000">Every so often it's nice to be
able to break the bonds of society and escape into a fantasy world where you can
have magical powers, superior fighting skills, and a completely different
personality.&nbsp; With the competitive nature of the world today providing a
surplus of unpleasant pressures to each and every one of us, this fantasy world
is all the more tempting to visit.&nbsp; About once a month, I spend my time
fighting off monsters with a padded PVC pipe weapon and healing my comrades in
battle so we can accomplish our goals.&nbsp; Throughout the weekend, you see
heroic victories, courageous stands, mind-boggling mysteries solved, and
complete strangers questing together as friends (and almost always, in time,
friends in the real world as well).</font></p>

<img border="0" src="images/brel.jpg" style="float: left;" hspace="10" alt="Brel Swanfire, Cleric of Lumina, goddess of life" width="191" height="305">The
character I role-play is named Brel Swanfire.&nbsp; He's a cleric that worships
the goddess of life, Lumina (or Luminus ... they keep changing the name).&nbsp;
Through my faith in Lumina, I'm able to pray for the power to heal my comrades,
ward off zombies, and even force my enemies to drop to their knees in
reverence.&nbsp; I'm part of an adventuring group called &quot;Dominion's
Creed&quot; that consists of a group of friends I first met during high school,
college, and a couple just during role-playing weekends.&nbsp; It's incredibly
fun and enjoyed by teenagers and middle-aged men alike, so I suggest you might
even want to keep an eye out for such a role-playing group in your area and try
it out.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="4" color="#008000">The group I participate in is
called Mystic Realms, a role-playing group that devised its own system,
organized by Anthony Kukal, usually located in or near Medford, New Jersey, USA.&nbsp; Below are two links to related web sites.&nbsp; The
first site, Angelic Dreams, is incredible, maintained by my friend who goes by
the alias of Cyle McKai who does an excellent job with both photography and
humor.&nbsp; (I make sure to help out with the proofreading though.)&nbsp; The
second site,&nbsp; the official Mystic Realms web page, is not very well
maintained but might provide some extra info you might be interested in.</font></p>
