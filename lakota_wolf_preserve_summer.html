the summer, wolves look like skinny creatures, because they lose much
of their thick coat of winter fur. &nbsp;This arctic wolf looks a tad
embarrassed.<br><br><br><img src="images/lakota_wolf_preserve/summer/timber_wolf_standing.jpg" alt=""><br>This ninja-like timber wolf would have totally snuck up on me--if it wasn't for the fence.<br><br><br><img src="images/lakota_wolf_preserve/summer/timber_wolf_walking.jpg" alt=""><br>Another
timber wolf walking along the fence. &nbsp;These wolves apparently
loved the fence during the summer. &nbsp;They brush up against it a
lot, probably to get rid of fleas.<br><br><br><img src="images/lakota_wolf_preserve/summer/tundra_wolf_howling.jpg" alt=""><br>This
old tundra wolf was busy howling all day. &nbsp;The others howled too,
but this wolf had the creepiest howl. &nbsp;What they do is have
someone in the tour group, usually a little boy, howl &nbsp;in the
middle of the four packs of wolves. &nbsp;If it's an energetic enough
howl, the wolves will join in. &nbsp;If not, the guy talking about the
wolves will take out some sort of whistle that makes a howl-like sound,
and that will usually work. &nbsp;They also respond to the local fire
siren, so it's an interesting town to live in.<br><br><br><img src="images/lakota_wolf_preserve/summer/tundra_wolf_standing.jpg" alt=""><br>This wolf has mastered the hungry look.<br><br><br><img src="images/lakota_wolf_preserve/summer/tundra_wolves_lounging.jpg" alt=""><br>These wolves are just chilling like a bunch of prima donnas looking good for the camera.<br><br><br><img src="images/lakota_wolf_preserve/summer/tundra_wolves_marching.jpg" alt=""><br>More wolves marching by, knowing the tourists pay for the frozen blocks of meat they're fed.<br><br><br><img src="images/lakota_wolf_preserve/summer/wolf_breath.jpg" alt=""><br>One wolf remains vigilant while the other starts to doze off.<br><br><br><img src="images/lakota_wolf_preserve/summer/wolf_sleeping.jpg" alt=""><br>And
this one dozes off too. &nbsp;There's no predators in the wolf
preserve. &nbsp;Perhaps a chipmunk will escape this wolf's wrath,
however.<br><br><br><img src="images/lakota_wolf_preserve/summer/red_fox_looking_at_food.jpg" alt=""><br>A&nbsp;red fox spies a treat expectantly.<br><br><br><br><a href="lakota_wolf_preserve.html">Back</a><br><br><br></div></body></html>
