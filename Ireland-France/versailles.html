of my main targets when visiting Paris was just outside of Paris, in
Versailles. &nbsp;The Palace of Versailles, where lots of treaties were
signed and where royalty lived. &nbsp;This is just a pretty road
leading up to it.<br><br><br><img src="images/France/Versailles/222.JPG" alt=""><br>The
Palace of Versailles! &nbsp;Will refer to it just as "Versailles",
although that could also refer to the town this is in. &nbsp;It was a
bit difficult to figure out what I was looking at. &nbsp;Is that one
building or a collection of them? &nbsp;Nothing was particularly
threatening, so I went in to investigate.<br>&nbsp;<br><br><img src="images/France/Versailles/224.JPG" alt=""><br>They just did some sort of restoration to Versaille's golden gate. &nbsp;The hinges were secure, so there was no way I could steal it.<br><br><br><img src="images/France/Versailles/226.JPG" alt=""><br>A
statue outside of Versailles. &nbsp;The lines were quite long, so you
could understand me taking this picture while I was waiting.<br><br><br><img src="images/France/Versailles/228.JPG" alt=""><br>While
you can see some renovation going on in the back, the thing I wanted to
point out is that odd little gold balloon thing. &nbsp;I don't know if
King Louis XIV ever knew what a balloon was. &nbsp;He died in 1715 and
the first balloon was invented in 1709, so it was a close call.
&nbsp;He might have been too loony to care about new inventions.<br><br><br><img src="images/France/Versailles/229.JPG" alt=""><br>Here's a chapel the King Louises liked to pray in.<br><br><br><img src="images/France/Versailles/231.JPG" alt=""><br>Versailles was full of artwork, much of it depicting battle scenes. &nbsp;What am I looking at here, tanks?<br><br><br><img src="images/France/Versailles/232.JPG" alt=""><br>A fun painting with a bloody slaughter, an angry volcano, and a feathery commander with an angel flying overhead.<br><br><br><img src="images/France/Versailles/233.JPG" alt=""><br>There
were plenty of portraits. &nbsp;Portraiture was big business back in
those days. &nbsp;Some showed props depicting what the subject's job
was. &nbsp;Eventually they moved away from that, wanting the portrait
to describe the person without props.<br><br><br><img src="images/France/Versailles/234.JPG" alt=""><br>Many might think of urns holding ashes of loved ones. &nbsp;This one is too big for that though. &nbsp;Perfect for jungle juice at a frat party though!<br><br><br><img src="images/France/Versailles/235.JPG" alt=""><br>Right now, I'm using a $30 dresser I bought off Craigslist.<br><br><br><img src="images/France/Versailles/237.JPG" alt=""><br>Just a tip. &nbsp;Adjusting contrast in Photoshop does wonders for these cool warrior statues.<br><br><br><img src="images/France/Versailles/238.JPG" alt=""><br>Here's
another silly balloon sculpture. &nbsp;They were exhibiting an artist
that likes balloon sculptures, so every room in the chateau had
something equally silly in it. &nbsp;I wanted to see Versailles, not
someinflatable canine. <br><br><br><img src="images/France/Versailles/239.JPG" alt=""><br>Just like many ceilings in Rome, this painting showed an opening to heaven.<br><br><br><img src="images/France/Versailles/240.JPG" alt=""><br>King Louis's bed. &nbsp;I didn't measure it, so no, I don't know if it was king-sized. &nbsp;Probably not.<br><br><br><img src="images/France/Versailles/241.JPG" alt=""><br>Glass chandeliers have to be a pain to clean up if they ever fall.<br><br><br><img src="images/France/Versailles/242.JPG" alt=""><br>While viewing the chateau, I peeked outside and saw some of the garden.<br><br><br><img src="images/France/Versailles/243.JPG" alt=""><br>Look at that! &nbsp;In that elegant white sculpture, they have the horse trampling that poor guy. &nbsp;What a horrible death!<br><br><br><img src="images/France/Versailles/245.JPG" alt=""><br>Here's
something famous. &nbsp;The Hall of Mirrors. &nbsp;It looks good here,
but being there, it felt like it was hard for royalty to astonish their
guests any better. &nbsp;You had an amazing view of the garden, and so
much light reflecting off mirrors and chandeliers and...wait a sec.
&nbsp;What's that blue thing back there! &nbsp;It's a balloon
sculpture! &nbsp;How awful!<br><br><br><img src="images/France/Versailles/246.JPG" alt=""><br>I
could've sworn I took a picture of the king's bed already. &nbsp;Maybe
this was for a different King Louis. &nbsp;King Louis XIV, XV, and XVI
all could have slept here.<br><br><br><img src="images/France/Versailles/247.JPG" alt=""><br>Here's
the queen's bed. &nbsp;I couldn't take a picture of the whole bed.
&nbsp;Either the top or bottom. &nbsp;And I didn't want to make you
look at two pictures of the same bed. &nbsp;Therefore, you get the half
I liked better -- the canopy.<br><br><br><img src="images/France/Versailles/248.JPG" alt=""><br>The
gardens of Versailles were huge. &nbsp;These guys are the masters of
hedge-clipping. &nbsp;I bet Edward Scissorhands would bow in reverence.<br><br><br><img src="images/France/Versailles/250.JPG" alt=""><br>I
took this picture, because the guy taking my picture in front of this
didn't get a very good angle. &nbsp;This lets you see the angel-sphinx
sculpture unobstructed. &nbsp;Note the nose is intact. &nbsp;Pesky
Napolean.<br><br><br><img src="images/France/Versailles/251.JPG" alt=""><br>Me
at Versailles. &nbsp;Note my Guinness jacket still looks pretty swank
even in Versailles. &nbsp;In fact, see my watch? &nbsp;The guy who sold
me my ticket actually complimented me on it. &nbsp;My watch is that
impressive. &nbsp;Oh crap. &nbsp;My sweater's tucked in. &nbsp;So much
for being fashionable. &nbsp;It doesn't look THAT bad, does it? &nbsp;I
don't get why you can't tuck in sweaters.<br><br><br><img src="images/France/Versailles/254.JPG" alt=""><br>Lots of tiny flowers at Versailles made me switch my camera to digital macro mode.<br><br><br><img src="images/France/Versailles/255.JPG" alt=""><br>Some purple tiny flowers.<br><br><br><img src="images/France/Versailles/257.JPG" alt=""><br>Here's
a tiny pink flower. &nbsp;When you magnify things enough, it seems like
you're looking at pictures from a hidden, alien world.<br><br><br><img src="images/France/Versailles/258.JPG" alt=""><br>A sweeping shot of a hedge cut to look like something, looking out over the lake.<br><br><br><img src="images/France/Versailles/259.JPG" alt=""><br>I zoomed in on that something.<br><br><br><img src="images/France/Versailles/262.JPG" alt=""><br>The
hedge is apparently a horse, at least on one side. &nbsp;You can see
the people underneath to get an idea about how huge it was.<br><br><br><img src="images/France/Versailles/261.JPG" alt=""><br>I
liked seeing the palace as a backdrop to the garden. &nbsp;It is weird
to see a garden where so many of the plants are not... well... planted.<br><br><br><img src="images/France/Versailles/264.JPG" alt=""><br>Here's one of the outer hedge-walls of the vast labyrinth of the Versailles gardens.<br><br><br><img src="images/France/Versailles/265.JPG" alt=""><br>This is one of the pathways leading into the garden.<br><br><br><img src="images/France/Versailles/281.JPG" alt=""><br>You can see this hedge-walled path leads past two fountains.<br><br><br><img src="images/France/Versailles/266.JPG" alt=""><br>I
took that pathway and made a few turns. &nbsp;Eventually I came to this
crossroad. &nbsp;A lot of times, you could look around and see where
the palace was. &nbsp;I was never in a large&nbsp;maze before though,
so I did the best I could to forget where I was and find confusing
places. &nbsp;I could not see the palace from here!<br><br><br><img src="images/France/Versailles/267.JPG" alt=""><br>Here's a map and an explanation of much of this.<br><br><br><img src="images/France/Versailles/269.JPG" alt=""><br>Another winding path in the Queen's Grove.<br><br><br><img src="images/France/Versailles/270.JPG" alt=""><br>None
of the fountains were running. &nbsp;It was admittedly cold while I was
there. &nbsp;Not cold enough to freeze this water, nor to stop me from
exploring. &nbsp;I planned on spending 3 hours at Versailles, then
maybe seeing the Louvre afterward. &nbsp;I ended up spending the whole
day here, and not because I was lost. &nbsp;It was just so cool to find
new things around each corner.<br><br><br><img src="images/France/Versailles/273.JPG" alt=""><br>Here you can see I obviously was not lost. &nbsp;The palace was in easy sight here.<br><br><br><img src="images/France/Versailles/277.JPG" alt=""><br>I
expected to find sculptures and fountains in the garden. &nbsp;Maybe
even some animals. &nbsp;I did not expect to find this tasty meal.
&nbsp;They had a cafe you could rest at, if you could find it.<br><br><br><img src="images/France/Versailles/278.JPG" alt=""><br>Each sculpture had a plaque next to it, identifying what you were looking at.<br><br><br><img src="images/France/Versailles/279.JPG" alt=""><br>A fountain surrounded by fake metal grass.<br><br><br><img src="images/France/Versailles/280.JPG" alt=""><br>Here's
a map of the Versailles gardens. &nbsp;You could actually use this to
follow the paths that King Louis XIV used to walk during his day.
&nbsp;It couldn't have been the same paths every time, could it?<br><br><br><img src="images/France/Versailles/284.JPG" alt=""><br>One more pretty garden pic before I left.<br><br><br><img src="images/France/Versailles/285.JPG" alt=""><br>I
wandered around the town of Versailles afterward, just to see what it
was like. &nbsp;It seemed rather normal, with little food shops and
some clothes stores. &nbsp;This was where King Louis XIV went for his
anime fix.<br><br><br><img src="images/France/Versailles/287.JPG" alt=""><br>The expensive hotels near Versailles looked like they could be tourist attractions too.<br><br><br><br><a href="paris.html">Back</a><br></div></body></html>
