<img src="images/Ireland/Dublin/023.JPG" alt=""><br>Getting to Dublin
was fairly easy. &nbsp;This was going to be my first real
"couchsurfing" adventure. &nbsp;I use <a href="http://www.couchsurfing.com">www.couchsurfing.com</a> fairly
regularly
to chat with people around the world. &nbsp;Us chatters were having a
get-together here in Dublin. &nbsp;I, along with a few others, were
promised by one local a place to stay in a place called the "Couching
House". &nbsp;These were the types of houses we saw along the way.<br><br><br><img src="images/Ireland/Dublin/018.JPG" alt=""><br>Found the place! &nbsp;This is the front door...<br><br><br><img src="images/Ireland/Dublin/017.JPG" alt=""><br>Near
the front door is the room we were staying in. &nbsp;Fairly spacious,
until you pile 5 people in there. &nbsp;That beanbag was very large and
comfy. &nbsp;Two spots on the sofas, and floorspace for 2 air
mattresses.<br><br><br><img src="images/Ireland/Dublin/019.JPG" alt=""> &nbsp; &nbsp;<img src="images/Ireland/Dublin/020.JPG" alt=""><br>The
stairs were decorated with pictures from around the world. &nbsp;At the
top, there was a bathroom, and also a bunch of doors that led to the
bedrooms of our maybe four or five hosts that lived there.<br><br><br><img src="images/Ireland/Dublin/016.JPG" alt=""><br>The place was a bit messy here and there, but immaculate considering the challenge they endure, hosting so many travellers.<br><br><br><img src="images/Ireland/Dublin/014.JPG" alt=""><br>We were told to make ourselves at home and help ourselves to anything anywhere.<br><br><br><img src="images/Ireland/Dublin/015.JPG" alt=""><br>The backyard was filled with plush, shaggy grass, suitable for Arty the cat to romp around and hide in.<br><br>
<br>
<img src="images/Ireland/Dublin/013.JPG" alt=""><br>
You might be wondering why there's a creepy ghost in this picture.
&nbsp;So anyway, the four pictured here include two of our hosts, and
two fellow couchsurfers. &nbsp;The guy in red, Dan, is the guy who
manages the rent and gave us the semi-formal invite. &nbsp;Graham,
being transcendental with his crappy beer (especially crappy in Dublin)
is wearing black. &nbsp;To the left of them is Barry from&nbsp;Scotland
who taught me how exactly to pronounce "cheers" in Scottish Gaelic;
"Slainte Mhath", as far as I could tell, sounds like "Slon-zhay Va"
&nbsp;I'm pretty sure I'm a bit off, but less than you think. &nbsp;Oh,
and sitting down in front is Andrea from&nbsp;England.<br>
<br>
<br>
<img src="images/Ireland/Dublin/012.JPG" alt=""><br>To the left is
another host, Sara from Mexico. &nbsp;There was a fourth host, Sarah
from Germany, but I don't think I got a picture of her. &nbsp;So
there's Andrea again. &nbsp;Not to worry. &nbsp;Later on, there are
plenty of non-ponytail shots. &nbsp;It was a running joke I embraced,
actually. &nbsp;To sign up with www.couchsurfing.com, you have to make
a profile. &nbsp;Usually these include photos. &nbsp;Andrea has plenty,
but way too many hide her face, showing just the ponytail.<br><br><br>&nbsp;<img src="images/Ireland/Dublin/021.JPG" alt=""><br>
Here's Graham still with his crappy beer, but playing very non-crappy
music. &nbsp;Our hosts stopped at nothing to make us feel at peace.<br>
<br>
<br>
<img src="images/Ireland/Dublin/arty.jpg" alt=""><br>Here's Arty the
cat, hiding in his patented shaggy grass, waiting to pounce on the
first evildoer who even mentions a lawn mower.<br><br><br><img src="images/Ireland/Dublin/022.JPG" alt=""><br>
Eventually Arty got tired of that and took a nap on the beanbag.
&nbsp;Throughout the night, Arty likes walking around the couch surfer
room, jumping and sleeping on anyone in there. &nbsp;It was cute.<br>
<br>
<br>
<img src="images/Ireland/Dublin/025.JPG" alt=""><br>
Here came my moment. &nbsp;My first real Guinness. &nbsp;No, that's not
me. &nbsp;It's my "grizzled Irishman" shot. &nbsp;I looked around for
the perfect bar to drink my first Guinness in Dublin. &nbsp;I know the
recipe of non-exported Guinness is actually different, so considering
how much I like Guinness, I was trembling in anticipation of this
moment. &nbsp;I found one with a huge Guinness advertisement above it.
&nbsp;Not too fancy, not too shabby. &nbsp;Just right! &nbsp;I told the
bartender it'd be my first real Guinness. &nbsp;He took the added
pressure in stride. &nbsp;I asked this guy what customary tipping is.
&nbsp;He told me, "Don't tip! You'll ruin our fucking economy!"
&nbsp;The memories! &nbsp;By the way. &nbsp;The Guinness was exquisite! &nbsp;I love Guinness!<br>
<br>
<br>
<img src="images/Ireland/Dublin/026.JPG" alt=""><br>
This sign didn't look right. &nbsp;Must be Gaelic.<br>
<br>
<br>
<img src="images/Ireland/Dublin/029.JPG" alt=""><br>
This spike pierces upwards from the very heart of the Irish. &nbsp;They
thought it'd make Dublin look more modern. &nbsp;I guess it achieved
that. &nbsp;I would describe it as "recognizable". &nbsp;Ol' Spiky
looks amazing at night too. &nbsp;The very tip lights up, along with 4
or so other dots. &nbsp;After trying the Guinness, I understood how
they thought to put this spike here. &nbsp;It all makes sense.<br>
<br>
<br>
<img src="images/Ireland/Dublin/035.JPG" alt=""><br>
Ol' Spiky is in line with other ornaments along O'Connell Street.<br>
<br><br><img src="images/Ireland/Dublin/032.JPG" alt=""><br>This man is obviously someone important. &nbsp;I was expecting leprechauns instead of angels though.<br><br>
<br>
<img src="images/Ireland/Dublin/031.JPG" alt=""><br>Aha! &nbsp;Got the
name on this one, so I could use Wikipedia. &nbsp;James Larkin was a
man who worked tirelessly to unionize Irish workers. &nbsp;Dublin
United Tramway Company didn't want Jim to unionize his workers, so
there was a seven month lockout that revolutionized unionization in
Ireland. &nbsp;<br><br><br><img src="images/Ireland/Dublin/034.JPG" alt=""><br>We reached a bridge over the main river in Dublin. &nbsp;Here's a view to the left.<br><br><br><img src="images/Ireland/Dublin/036.JPG" alt=""><br>
Here's a view to the right. &nbsp;In my opinion, they should keep this side and get rid of the other side.<br>
<br>
<br>
<img src="images/Ireland/Dublin/039.JPG" alt=""><br>
I peeked around Dublin and found that they have what they claim is a
highly respected, competitive college -- Trinity College. &nbsp;Now,
I'm not sure how prestigious it really is. &nbsp;I checked the world
rankings of colleges. &nbsp;Harvard was #1, Oxford was #8. &nbsp;My
undergrad college, Rutgers, was near 40. &nbsp;Trinity wasn't even
mentioned. &nbsp;Maybe the Guinness makes it harder to be academic.<br>
<br>
<br>
<img src="images/Ireland/Dublin/041.JPG" alt=""><br>
To be fair, it SEEMED like an impressive university. &nbsp;The campus did compare to those of Harvard and Columbia.<br>
<br>
<br>
<img src="images/Ireland/Dublin/043.JPG" alt=""><br>
Funky Trinity College sculptures. &nbsp;This probably would have been recognizable if not for the beer.<br>
<br><br>
<img src="images/Ireland/Dublin/044.JPG" alt=""><br>I walk by this
place that looks like it has excellent fish n' chips. &nbsp;Andrea was
going on about how she was in the mood for fish n' chips, so I had it
on my mind too. &nbsp;This place had a special, "smoked cod".
&nbsp;Sounded damn good! &nbsp;I order it. &nbsp;"Sorry, we're out."
&nbsp;I ask for unsmoked cod! &nbsp;None. &nbsp;I like salmon!
&nbsp;How about salmon! &nbsp;"Sorry". &nbsp;"Okay, what fish DO you
have?" &nbsp;"The haddock is nice..." &nbsp;"But do you have it?"
&nbsp;"No" &nbsp;... Okay, they did have the haddock, and aside from a
few bones, it was quite good!<br><br><br><img src="images/Ireland/Dublin/snow_n_kerri.jpg" alt=""><br>
Afterrward, I finally met up with the rest of the couchsurfing.com
crew! &nbsp;We originally met at a place called "The Living Room".
&nbsp;Noisy bar that we decided to move away from, for conversation's
sake. &nbsp;We spent a lot of time moving around, but eventually
settled down here, where I took this picture. &nbsp;To the left is
Kerri, who I've actually met before in couchsurfing get-togethers in
New York and Philadelphia. &nbsp;In retrospect, she was the only one
I've met before. &nbsp;To the right is Dave of England. &nbsp;He
doesn't like having his picture taken. &nbsp;I complimented his hair.
&nbsp;He said it's a wig and I could borrow it.<br>
<br>
<br>
<img src="images/Ireland/Dublin/046.JPG" alt=""><br>
What are we drinking? &nbsp;Irnbru! &nbsp;Made from girders. &nbsp;It's
the Scottish equivalent of Mountain Dew. &nbsp;Tastes a little orangy.
&nbsp;So Barry was on a quest to find it somewhere in Ireland. &nbsp;It
was a lot harder than he'd have liked, but, we found it! &nbsp;Here's
free Irnbru advertising. &nbsp;Barry didn't want to pose. &nbsp;He
wanted to drink his Irnbru.<br>
<br>
<br>

Infamous ponytail drinking Irnbru.<br>

Walking around Dublin, I was nearly missed by this pigeon doing you-know-what.<br>
<br>
<br>
<img src="images/Ireland/Dublin/056.JPG" alt=""><br>We made it out to a
park near Dublin where everyone was being sporty. &nbsp;I got to play
soccer in Europe for the first time. &nbsp;It was with a bunch of
amateurs, but I stink and haven't played much since I was little.
&nbsp;I scored our team's only two goals! &nbsp;(by luck) &nbsp;Even
used my head for a scoring attempt. &nbsp;I had fun! &nbsp;Yay!<br><br><br><img src="images/Ireland/Dublin/055.JPG" alt=""><br>
This is my new Italian friend, Chiara, practicing what she calls
"kiwido" and others call "poi". &nbsp;It's basically swinging around
these things with tails, tied to strings, often along with music. &nbsp;Chiara was pretty good!<br>
<br>
<br>
<img src="images/Ireland/Dublin/054.JPG" alt=""><br>
Vanessa was not as good, because it was new to her too, but she was
still better than I was. &nbsp;I tried, and I hit myself a lot. &nbsp;I
blame Chiara, but she maintains her innocence.<br>
<br>
<br>
<img src="images/Ireland/Dublin/062.JPG" alt=""><br>
I loved this picture for many reasons. &nbsp;It's artistic. &nbsp;It's
dramatic. &nbsp;It's beautiful. &nbsp;But it's also the first picture I
took on the Guinness Storehouse tour. &nbsp;Guinness is mostly water,
like all beer. &nbsp;Guinness has a section of their brewery tour
describing the purity of their water sources, and they provide this
waterfall for oohs and ahhs.<br>
<br>
<br>
<img src="images/Ireland/Dublin/063.JPG" alt=""><br>
Along the tour, they advertise a low alcohol Guinness. &nbsp;This man
with zombie eyes I found very hard to photo-edit, provided us with free
samples.<br>
<br>
<br>
<img src="images/Ireland/Dublin/064.JPG" alt=""><br>
More beery exhibits along the tour.<br>
<br>
<br>
<img src="images/Ireland/Dublin/065.JPG" alt=""><br>
In this door, they talk about the cask-building industry. &nbsp;I
watched a wonderful little video showing a barrel being constructed.
&nbsp;They mention how it was quite the artform at its peak, but
suddenly Guinness went to the much more reliable metal containers, and
the barrel-makers had to build something else instead.<br>
<br>
<br>
<img src="images/Ireland/Dublin/068.JPG" alt=""><br>
Admission to the Guinness Storehouse tour included a free Guinness.
&nbsp;You can imagine how difficult it was for me to read through each
exhibit when all I really wanted was their beer. &nbsp;Here I was..andguess who I met? <br>
<br>
<br>
<img src="images/Ireland/Dublin/071.JPG" alt=""><br>
Oh, right, Guinness first. &nbsp;Look at the foam! &nbsp;They are
masters at pouring Guinness. &nbsp;They use the tap delicately to trace
shamrocks into the Guinness foam.<br>
<br>
<br>
<img src="images/Ireland/Dublin/074.JPG" alt=""><br>
Behold, Guinness right from the Guinness fountain.<br>
<br>
<br>
<img src="images/Ireland/Dublin/075.JPG" alt=""><br>
Oh, right, I met these two, and one other they were hanging out with.
&nbsp;They're American couchsurfers! &nbsp;Twins I think. &nbsp;I
couldn't tell the difference between them. &nbsp;They were two of the
guys I played soccer with too. &nbsp;Anyway, what you should notice
here is not any of that, but how many Guinnesses they're holding.
&nbsp;You're only supposed to get one per person! &nbsp;They have two
each, and they had much more than that beforehand. &nbsp;These two were
the masters of getting free Guinnesses. &nbsp;They didn't even have to
trick anyone. &nbsp;Apparently the bartenders liked them. &nbsp;They
gave me some free Guinness too. &nbsp;I will always think fondly of
them.<br>
<br>
<br>
<img src="images/Ireland/Dublin/077.JPG" alt=""><br>
In the Guinness tour, they had a huge projection screen showing Guinness foam.<br>
<br>
<br>
<img src="images/Ireland/Dublin/078.JPG" alt=""><br>
Here's a place you can go if you wanted to just buy Guinness at a bar. &nbsp;It was closed when I passed through.<br>
<br>
<br>
<img src="images/Ireland/Dublin/079.JPG" alt=""><br>
After the tour, I headed over to the next big couchsurfing meetup.
&nbsp;We were supposed to get together at a bar I've seen before called
"The Blue Goose". &nbsp;I forgot where it was though, so it took me a
bit, but I made it there nice n' early. &nbsp;We were promised free
food too, but they wouldn't serve it until there was way too big a
crowd to feed. &nbsp;That was annoying, and they had pretty loud music
too, but there were so many couchsurfers there. &nbsp; Not just the
ones I chatted with, but also a huge bunch of Irish couchsurfers.
&nbsp;So many of them wanted to chat with me. &nbsp;I felt loved :)<br>
<br>
<br>
<img src="images/Ireland/Dublin/080.JPG" alt=""><br>
I wish I had time to meet all of them, but the few I did get to meet
left me with priceless memories. &nbsp;This guy's name is Quiche.
&nbsp;Just before I took this picture, he said, "I... am a leek!"
&nbsp;He was demonstrating to another couchsurfer what a leek looked
like.<br>
<br>
<br>
<img src="images/Ireland/Dublin/081.JPG" alt=""><br>
Here's Barry again. &nbsp;He put on his kilt, in preparation for a
soccer game he was going to watch at a pub. &nbsp;Don't ask any of the
usual, "Omigosh, what do you wear under that?" questions. &nbsp;Don't.<br>
<br>
<br>
<img src="images/Ireland/Dublin/165.JPG" alt=""><br>
This&nbsp;statue stood near the famous Temple Bar in downtown Dublin.
&nbsp;I walked by and felt someone tap me on the shoulder. &nbsp;I
looked around, wondering who did that. &nbsp;I noticed this statue and
saw the cane it was holding. &nbsp;As Sherlock Holmes used to say,
eliminate the probable and the improbable must be true. &nbsp;I figured
this statue was a living person with the gall to actually stick his
cane out and tap people on the back of the shoulder. &nbsp;I was right.
&nbsp;He also every so often jumped suddenly, scaring the crap out of
unsuspecting tourists.<br>
<br>
<br>
<img src="images/Ireland/Dublin/168.JPG" alt=""><br>
Here's a cheerful old dude dancing and singing along with a street band. &nbsp;He had some moves, let me tell you. <br>
<br>
<br>
<img src="images/Ireland/Dublin/173.JPG" alt=""><br>Or maybe I'll just show you!<br><br><br><img src="images/Ireland/Dublin/169.JPG" alt=""><br>
He was so exciting, this frat boy got up there and wanted to dance with
him. &nbsp;Old dude wanted no part though, so the frat boy tried to
laugh it off, only to get rightfully ridiculed by his friends.<br>
<br>
<br>
<img src="images/Ireland/Dublin/174.JPG" alt=""><br>
This is the famous touristy Temple Bar in downtown Dublin.<br>
<br>
<br>
<img src="images/Ireland/Dublin/175.JPG" alt=""><br>
Another crowded bar scene in the Temple Bar. &nbsp;It was interesting
trying to get to and from the toilet. &nbsp;As the night went on, it
got more and more tightly packed.<br>
<br>
<br>
<img src="images/Ireland/Dublin/176.JPG" alt=""><br>
At first it wasn't too bad though. &nbsp;Vanessa, Andrea and I found
these three empty bar stools to enjoy our drinks on. &nbsp;Soon we
learned the stools were reserved for the live entertainment, and it was
currently between acts. &nbsp;People started cheering for us to start
performing. &nbsp;Vanessa goaded Andrea to do her little strip tease.
&nbsp;I don't know if she actually has one, but the people were hungry
for anything.<br>
<br>
<br>
<img src="images/Ireland/Dublin/177.JPG" alt=""><br>
Eventually we got booted and these two took over. &nbsp;They were much
better performers than we were. &nbsp;Check out the Ramones shirt!
&nbsp;That tells you he knows at least three chords.<br>
<br>
<br>
<img src="images/Ireland/Dublin/179.JPG" alt=""><br>
When we got back to the house that night, we were greeted by this
little diddy stealthily written by Barry, the Scottish ninja bard, who
says it's a Glaswegian (from Glasgow) nursery rhyme. &nbsp;Andrea
and I went into song, singing about tossing grandmothers onto rough
asphalt at high speeds.<br>
<br>
<br>
<img src="images/Ireland/Dublin/180.JPG" alt=""><br>
It was our last night together in Dublin, so we ended up getting a bit
drunk. &nbsp;A toy moose became quite
the prop, along with Vanessa's banana.<br>
<br>
<br>
<img src="images/Ireland/Dublin/181.JPG" alt=""><br>
I admit these two more drunk than I was.<br>
<br>
<br>
<img src="images/Ireland/Dublin/182.JPG" alt=""><br>
While drunk, it was hard to try to get all of us in the picture.
&nbsp;Try as I might, I always ended up on the wrong side of the
camera. &nbsp;The camera eventually got fed up with my drunken efforts
and took this picture for me.<br>
