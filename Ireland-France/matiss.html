the Spiderman jacket. &nbsp;For some reason, smart little kids often
get obsessed with something random and learn a lot about it.
&nbsp;Spiderman was Matiss's first love, but now he likes London. &nbsp;No story behind it. &nbsp;He just likes London.<br><br><br><img src="images/France/Montpellier/matiss/464.JPG" alt=""><br>Matiss
also loves having his picture taken, a lot. &nbsp;His mother, Vanessa,
knows this, so she had him pose for a few pictures, this time clinging
to a fence.<br><br><br><img src="images/France/Montpellier/matiss/466.JPG" alt=""><br>Vanessa calls out for Matiss to pose with the carousel this time!<br><br><br><img src="images/France/Montpellier/matiss/467.JPG" alt=""><br>And
one shot with Matiss giving a thumbs up. &nbsp;I chose the best of
many, many shots. &nbsp;Matiss fell off the fence shortly after this
