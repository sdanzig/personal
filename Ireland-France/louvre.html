<body><div style="text-align: center;"><big><big><big>The Louvre</big></big></big><br><br><br><br><br><img src="images/France/Paris/311.JPG" alt=""><br>Number two and last of the things I had to see in Paris was the Louvre.
&nbsp;I wasn't sure where to enter the Louvre, but I walked in the
vicinity and saw this building marked "Louvre" with people walking in.<br><br><br><img src="images/France/Paris/312.JPG" alt=""><br>This doesn't seem to be a museum. &nbsp;I saw people waiting on line (queueing) here, but apparently they already had tickets.<br><br><br><img src="images/France/Paris/314.JPG" alt=""><br>I
kept walking and ended up in this courtyard. &nbsp;This looked like the
Louvre I've seen pictures of and read about in the Da Vinci Code.<br><br><br><img src="images/France/Paris/315.JPG" alt=""><br>Inside the Louvre was this slick staircase and lots of sunlight, thanks to the glass pyramid above.<br><br><br><img src="images/France/Paris/317.JPG" alt=""><br>This
is the celebrated "Winged Victory of Samothrace". &nbsp;You may have
seen this before. &nbsp;Apparently one wing is just a plaster copy of
the other. &nbsp;As luck would have it, I took a picture toward the
fake side.<br><br><br><img src="images/France/Paris/320.JPG" alt=""><br>Leonardo
da Vinci exhibited "sfumato" in his Mona Lisa, to obscure whether or
not she is smiling. &nbsp;I took it a step further because it was hard
to get a clearer picture than this.<br><br><br><img src="images/France/Paris/323.JPG" alt=""><br>It
honestly wasn't as bad as I feared. &nbsp;I just had to wait half a
minute, then soon I was front and center taking pictures, with the
flash, of the world's most famous painting. &nbsp;I was happy to see
the Mona Lisa protected by polarized glass, but all the other paintings
were not, and people were taking flash photographs of everything in the
museum. &nbsp;There were no signs prohibiting flashes, let alone
photos. &nbsp;I asked the curator about this. &nbsp;She shrugged and
said it was okay.<br><br><br><img src="images/France/Paris/326.JPG" alt=""><br>This
painting, "The Wedding at Cana", sits directly opposite from the Mona
Lisa. &nbsp;The fact that this painting is in such stellar condition is
a testament to the art restoration industry. &nbsp;Apparently this
painting has been cut in half and stitched back together. &nbsp;It also
has had water damage from a leaking air vent and has been dropped, with
its metal framework puncturing the canvas in five places, including a 4
foot long tear. &nbsp;I can't see any of that. &nbsp;Apparently this
was looted from Venice. &nbsp;I bet the Italians would have treated
this painting better.<br><br><br><img src="images/France/Paris/329.JPG" alt=""><br>"Man
with a Glove", a portrait by one of my favorite classical artists,
Titian. &nbsp;He knew how to make a portrait look alive, while still
maintaining perfect balance.<br><br><br><img src="images/France/Paris/330.JPG" alt=""><br>The
"Raft of the Medusa" shows survivors from the Medusa, a French frigate,
right at the moment when they see they're going to be rescued.<br><br><br><img src="images/France/Paris/331.JPG" alt=""><br>Here's Hercules slugging the heads off of some poor multi-headed dog.<br><br><br><img src="images/France/Paris/335.JPG" alt=""><br>This time Hercules is beating up Achelous, the Greek river god.<br><br><br><img src="images/France/Paris/332.JPG" alt=""><br>The
statue of Mercury, seemingly in mid-flight. &nbsp;I saw this in Italy
too, I think in the Vatican Museum. &nbsp;Throughout my time in the
Louvre, I couldn't help but compare the two, because both museums
impressed me considerably.<br><br><br><img src="images/France/Paris/333.JPG" alt=""><br>I
liked the dual-material sculptures. &nbsp;The marble clothes looked
cool. &nbsp;I wonder if this was a precursor to the modern Barbie doll.
&nbsp;Extra points for the cute little owl though. &nbsp;I bet Barbie's
jealous.<br><br><br><img src="images/France/Paris/334.JPG" alt=""><br>What
a horrible death for this poor elk. &nbsp;I like the dog though.
&nbsp;He's got his little paw on its neck, playing tug-o-war with its
ear. &nbsp;Okay, maybe the elk would beg to differ about the dog.<br><br><br><img src="images/France/Paris/336.JPG" alt=""><br>Sculptures sunbathed in this glass-roofed courtyard.<br><br><br><img src="images/France/Paris/337.JPG" alt=""><br>Shiny!<br><br><br><img src="images/France/Paris/338.JPG" alt=""><br>This
is a sculpture of Scott Danzig next to the Code of Hammurabi.
&nbsp;Scott Danzig was born in 1976 in the city of New York. &nbsp;The
audio book hanging around his neck is a recent addition... Blah, you
don't care, do you? &nbsp;King Hammurabi inscribed 282 laws for the
people in ancient Babylon to follow. &nbsp;Hmph.<br><br><br><img src="images/France/Paris/339.JPG" alt=""><br>Here's a better look at Akkadian cuneiform.<br><br><br><img src="images/France/Paris/341.JPG" alt=""><br>Here's
a really old lion from the start of the second millenium -- BC.
&nbsp;I'm fascinated by ancient Mesopotamia, which includes this cat,
who was found in the "Temple of the Lions" in Mari, Syria. &nbsp;She
used to have teeth, able to snarl ferociously with them. &nbsp;She's
old though, and they don't make dentures her size.<br><br><br><img src="images/France/Paris/345.JPG" alt=""><br>I
zoomed in and took this picture through a magnifying glass they
provided. &nbsp;This was one of many tiny ancient little rollers which
imprints patterns on clay such as here.<br><br><br><img src="images/France/Paris/347.JPG" alt=""><br>Here's some of the Assyrian sculptures. &nbsp;Assyrians were very violent in general.<br><br><br><img src="images/France/Paris/348.JPG" alt=""><br>The Assyrians were especially violent if you made fun of their beards.<br><br><br><img src="images/France/Paris/350.JPG" alt=""><br>Here's a courtyard outside the Louvre. &nbsp;These hedges were no doubt shaped by the gardeners at Versailles. &nbsp;Nice hedges.<br><br><br><img src="images/France/Paris/351.JPG" alt=""><br>I
read about the "Madonna of Chancellor Rolin" a couple years ago.
&nbsp;In addition to saying I saw the Mona Lisa, I was interested
mainly in two parts of the Louvre, because I knew I'd not have time for
everything. The first was the Mesopotamian artifacts, and second was
the north-European artwork. &nbsp;One famous Dutch artist is Jan van
Eyck. &nbsp;The key here is that baby Jesus and company are made to
look large and important. &nbsp;The world behind them is tiny by
comparison.<br><br><br><img src="images/France/Paris/352.JPG" alt=""><br>Here's
a fun picture of the Tower of Babel by... Lucas van Valckenborgh?
&nbsp;Looks good. &nbsp;I always imagined the Tower of Babel as more
cylindrical. &nbsp;It doesn't look like they can get too high building
it like a cone.<br><br><br><img src="images/France/Paris/353.JPG" alt=""><br>Saint Jerome seems sad.<br><br><br><img src="images/France/Paris/354.JPG" alt=""><br>The interior of a church, painted by Hendrick van Steenwyk<br><br><br><img src="images/France/Paris/355.JPG" alt=""><br>Camels make me happy.<br><br><br><img src="images/France/Paris/356.JPG" alt=""><br>These angry monkeys spoiled my mood though.<br><br><br><img src="images/France/Paris/357.JPG" alt=""><br>Can you get any more angry-looking? &nbsp;I appreciate how this monkey's primal rage was captured, however.<br><br><br><img src="images/France/Paris/358.JPG" alt=""><br>As
I was finishing up my tour of the Louvre, I figured I should eat
something. &nbsp;This painting, "The Fish Market" by Frans Snyders,
killed my appetite.<br><br><br><img src="images/France/Paris/359.JPG" alt=""><br>I saw a man pointing his camera upwards. &nbsp;I went over to peek. &nbsp;Ooh! &nbsp;Nice angle!<br><br><br><img src="images/France/Paris/360.JPG" alt=""><br>Gratuitous Da Vinci Code shot. &nbsp;If you read the book or watched the movie, you might recognize this.<br><br><br><img src="images/France/Paris/361.JPG" alt=""><br>Here's a wooden model of the Louvre that I saw when I was trying to figure out how to get back to the subway.<br><br><br><img src="images/France/Paris/394.JPG" alt=""><br>Before
I headed off to the Arch of Triumph, I was treated to this view.
&nbsp;If you catch the pyramid just as it's lighting up, you'll see it
in green. &nbsp;This picture rocks.<br><br><br><br><a href="paris.html">Back</a><br></div></body></html>
