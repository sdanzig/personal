didn't plan on going to Montpellier initially. &nbsp;I figured Paris
would be nice to see while I was in Europe, so I would fit in about 5
days there. &nbsp;Then I decided to see friends in Lille, so it'd be 4
days in Paris. &nbsp;Then I chatted with Vanessa from Montpellier, who
really wanted me to visit her too. &nbsp;She said she'd make me crepes!
&nbsp;So there went another day from Paris. &nbsp; I met Vanessa first
in Dublin, and we became good friends there prior to my visit to her
hometown. &nbsp;Just to be clear, couchsurfing is a relatively innocent
activity, so don't think I had other intentions past just making a new
friend and being shown around. &nbsp;She never made me crepes (grrrr),
but based on the wonderful time I had in Montpellier and the not so
wonderful time I had in Paris, I don't regret it one bit. &nbsp; She
later proposed to me too. &nbsp;About the picture, Montpellier's center
is called the "Comedy". &nbsp;People in Montpellier are fond of jokes,
so this is appropriate.<br><br><br><img src="images/France/Montpellier/444.JPG" alt=""><br>Here's another shot of the Comedy, along with its mossy fountain.<br><br><br><br><img src="images/France/Montpellier/443.JPG" alt=""><br>Montpellier's children were stored here in this carousel when not in school.<br><br><br><img src="images/France/Montpellier/438.JPG" alt=""><br>So
I met up with Vanessa, and she showed me what touristy things
Montpellier has to offer. &nbsp;If a European city wants to be
touristy, it needs to start with a sculpture of a soldier on a horse,
as shown here.<br><br><br><img src="images/France/Montpellier/439.JPG" alt=""><br>If a French city wants to be touristy, in addition to the mounted soldier statue, it needs an arch too.<br><br><br><img src="images/France/Montpellier/440.JPG" alt=""><br>Okay, now they're just showing off.<br><br><br><img src="images/France/Montpellier/441.JPG" alt=""><br>France
is a relatively secular country compared to Italy. &nbsp;Every so often
Jesus pops up and tries to make you feel guilty. &nbsp;Here he's
following us around hopping on his crucifix-shaped pogo stick.<br><br><br><img src="images/France/Montpellier/471.JPG" alt=""><br>This
church reminds me a little of Notre Dame. &nbsp;Could Montpellier be
trying to emulate Paris? &nbsp;I hope not. &nbsp;Vanessa had to go
finish up something at work (she's a teacher), so I was left to wander
alone for a bit.<br><br><br><img src="images/France/Montpellier/479.JPG" alt=""><br>This picture was taken much later, obviously, but it's a touristy building shot so I grouped it here.<br><br><br><img src="images/France/Montpellier/446.JPG" alt=""><br>Here's a cool sculpture in a little flower garden I walked by.<br><br><br><img src="images/France/Montpellier/445.JPG" alt=""><br>The
guy playing white, wearing the light blue shirt, is going to win.
&nbsp;The guy playing black, on the far side of the board, is trying to
figure out how to save his king. &nbsp;He'll forfeit in the next turn
or two. &nbsp;This was interesting to watch, but the best part about it
was the smooth jazz playing in the background while they contemplated
their moves.<br><br><img src="images/France/Montpellier/451.JPG" alt=""><br>The
famous Fabre museum in Montpellier. &nbsp;Vanessa said that I should go
here. &nbsp;The paintings were nice and big and stuff, but after the
Louvre, I had my fill of museums for this trip. &nbsp;I paid the
admission fee and briskly wandered around looking for modern art, which
I'm usually in the mood to look at despite being tired of museums.<br><br><br><img src="images/France/Montpellier/452.JPG" alt=""><br>I
took a picture of this painting to demonstrate the type of art at the
Fabre museum, and to see how well I could eliminate glare. &nbsp;I was
a bit bored in this museum. &nbsp;Just then, I heard screaming from
somewhere. &nbsp;I was excited and started to run around like a fool
hoping to see a riot or some dramatic screaming piece of artwork.<br><br><br><img src="images/France/Montpellier/453.JPG" alt=""><br>Through a window, I saw what looked to be a bunch of mad scientists, like Brent Spiner's character in Independence Day.<br><br><br><img src="images/France/Montpellier/457.JPG" alt=""><br>These
guys were obviously students. &nbsp;I was told beforehand that
Montpellier is a big college town. &nbsp;In fact, there are a lot of
American exchange students that pass through here. &nbsp;Anyway, that
did not explain why these kids were running around screaming in white
coats decorated with graffiti. &nbsp;Note the hand prints on one dude's
butt.<br><br><br><img src="images/France/Montpellier/456.JPG" alt=""><br>Here's
another one jumping in the fountain with his raft.. a completely
submerged raft, resulting in a soaked college student. &nbsp;It was
fairly warm in Montpellier, which is on the south border of France, not
far from Spain, so this seemed refreshing at the time.<br><br><br><img src="images/France/Montpellier/461.JPG" alt=""><br>Here&nbsp;lots
of them are jumping up and down singing French songs and chants.
&nbsp;Apparently this whole ordeal is an initiation for the new
students. &nbsp;Also known as hazing. &nbsp;I didn't see any alcohol
though. &nbsp;I showed this picture to other French people, who
eventually told me what this all was, and apparently they all have gone
through this at some point. &nbsp;They recognized what was going on
instantly.<br><br><br><img src="images/France/Montpellier/437.JPG" alt=""><br>Vanessa
returned and said she needed to find a gift for her child, Matiss, in
the toystore. &nbsp;This was the "death by cop" section in the
toystore. &nbsp;We were looking for things having to do with music and
singing. &nbsp;She seemed interested in karaoke stuff and maybe a
keyboard with a drumpad. &nbsp;She was too short, so I had to help her
grab that from the top shelf.<br><br><br><img src="images/France/Montpellier/469.JPG" alt=""><br>Vanessa
and I picked up Matiss from school and took this greencard shot.
&nbsp;There's more pictures of Matiss later. &nbsp;We had a full photo
shoot. &nbsp;Matiss loves cameras.<br><br><br><img src="images/France/Montpellier/482.JPG" alt=""><br>We
met up with two of Vanessa's friends, Saida, a business consultant, and
Smahane, a biologist. &nbsp;From left to right, Matiss, Vanessa, Saida,
Smahane, Scott.<br><br><br><img src="images/France/Montpellier/480.JPG" alt=""><br>It
was Matiss's birthday, so Saida gave Vanessa this book as a gift.
&nbsp;It was a book about the children of the world. &nbsp;Unlike in
America, this book was rather explicit about things it wanted to
explain.<br><br><br><img src="images/France/Montpellier/481.JPG" alt=""><br>I
felt it appropriate for Smahane the biologist to show the page that
explains what test tube-babies are. &nbsp;Smahane was very funny.
&nbsp;She didn't speak English perfectly and was very self-conscious
about it, but I understood her fine. &nbsp;However, like many in
Montpellier, she liked to tell me jokes, and I tried to understand the
punch line. &nbsp;I think something was lost in translation, but I
loved watching her try to tell jokes. &nbsp;She didn't get my joke
either though. &nbsp;I'll have to come back one day with a joke in
French, to redeem myself.<br><br><br><img src="images/France/Montpellier/486.JPG" alt="">t<br>I
had a very peaceful stay at Vanessa's house. &nbsp;Matiss slept like a
rock and I had a rather large comfortable bed. &nbsp;I took a picture
of this interesting African mask she had hanging on a wall.<br><br><br><img src="images/France/Montpellier/483.JPG" alt=""><br>Vanessa
was away from Montpellier for a bit and someone was supposed to take
care of her prized plant. &nbsp;As you can see, it's dead, but it still
made for a priceless picture. &nbsp;Vanessa was very sad about my
departure. &nbsp;The morning I was about to leave, she had very sappy
music playing, and when I saw her online later, she pleaded for me to
come back and get married.<br><br><br>&nbsp;<br><a href="matiss.html">Matiss's photo shoot</a><br><br><br><br><a href="index.html">Back</a><br></div></body></html>
