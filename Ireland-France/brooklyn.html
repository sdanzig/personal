do I have Brooklyn listed in my Ireland-France vacation photos? &nbsp;I
met up with my Belarusian-American friend Aliona at Brighton Beach in
Brooklyn (she likes places that start with B) and had some authentic
Russian cuisine with her. &nbsp;Here she is eating borscht. &nbsp;We
drank a lot of vodka afterward. &nbsp;I had been preparing for my
upcoming Guinness-fest, so my alcohol tolerance was pretty good.
&nbsp;I thought I kept pace with her, but she probably was being nice
to me.<br><br><br><img src="images/Brooklyn/005.JPG" alt=""><br>After dinner, we hung out on the beach for a while before I headed off to the airport. &nbsp;Here's a picture of a seagull.<br><br>&nbsp;<br><a href="index.html">Back</a><br></div></body></html>
