<body><div style="text-align: center;"><big><big><big>Paris</big></big></big><br><br><br><br><br><br><img src="images/France/Paris/187.JPG" alt=""><br>I arrived in Paris and was hunting for my hostel. &nbsp;It wasn't in the most wonderful area, but it felt open and peaceful.<br><br><br><img src="images/France/Paris/189.JPG" alt=""><br>I took the scenic route to the hostel, walking along the water.<br><br><br><img src="images/France/Paris/188.JPG" alt=""><br>This is the most impressive building I saw on the way.<br><br><br><img src="images/France/Paris/190.JPG" alt=""><br>They tried to lift up my spirits by playing bocci ball.<br><br><br><img src="images/France/Paris/191.JPG" alt=""><br>I
made it to the St. Christopher-Paris hostel! &nbsp;It was a very
well-designed hostel, where you can slide out a cage, put your stuff in
it, lock it, and slide it back. &nbsp;However, my cage blocked the door
that 8 people needed to get through. &nbsp;Also, these cages were
awfully squeaky, and sometimes wouldn't slide back until shifted
around. &nbsp;I did like the curtain you could pull over for privacy.
&nbsp;They had little lights for each bed. &nbsp;My light bulb was
missing. &nbsp;I asked three times for them to either put the light
bulb in for me, or let me put one in. &nbsp;They would not do either.<br><br><br><img src="images/France/Paris/192.JPG" alt=""><br>It
was a mostly well-designed hostel, with a staff that really sucked
balls. &nbsp;I don't know if this hostel is a lot better or worse than
the other hostels in Paris. &nbsp;All I know is that people in Paris
were all very rude to me, with very few exceptions. &nbsp;A nice guy
named Gilras was an exception. &nbsp;Forgot to take a picture of him.<br><br><br><img src="images/France/Paris/193.JPG" alt=""><br>Every
so something clues you in to something that's wrong with you. &nbsp;I
get out of the subway and start trying to find the Eiffel Tower.
&nbsp;I fail to see ...this... behind me, and walk directly away.
&nbsp;Know that expression "Can't miss it!"? &nbsp;You can't use that
with me.<br><br><br><img src="images/France/Paris/194.JPG" alt=""><br>I started to walk under the Eiffel Tower.<br><br><br><img src="images/France/Paris/195.JPG" alt=""><br>It was big, but I figured it had to be big. &nbsp;People have been making such a big deal about it.
&nbsp;I debated whether to get my picture taken with the Eiffel Tower
in the background. &nbsp;Ultimately, I decided it did not deserve me in
a picture with it.<br><br><br><img src="images/France/Paris/196.JPG" alt=""><br>They had a carousel and other amusements near the Eiffel Tower, along with that horse statue.<br><br><br><img src="images/France/Paris/199.JPG" alt=""><br>I
made it up to the lower observation deck of the Eiffel tower.
&nbsp;This building drew the attention of my picture taking.
&nbsp;Before I go on, I'll assert that Paris is an absolutely beautiful
city. &nbsp;It's just the people were rude.<br><br><br><img src="images/France/Paris/202.JPG" alt=""><br>Here's a picture up the Eiffel tower from partway up. &nbsp;I hope it supposed to bend like that.<br><br><br><img src="images/France/Paris/204.JPG" alt=""><br>Just
like in Japan from the Tokyo Tower, I was able to watch a soccer game
from high up. &nbsp;I can't tell -- is there a goalie in that net?<br><br><br><img src="images/France/Paris/208.JPG" alt=""><br>Yay, the beautiful Seine river. &nbsp;It looks even better at night, but I liked the cloudscape.<br><br><br><img src="images/France/Paris/211.JPG" alt=""><br>Here's that flashy building from the top observation deck! &nbsp;It was significantly higher and higher priced.<br><br><br><img src="images/France/Paris/213.JPG" alt=""><br>When
you go to an observation deck, the typical thing to do is to walk
around and take a panoramic series of pictures. &nbsp;I'm not going to
make you look at all of them. &nbsp;Only one more.<br><br><br><img src="images/France/Paris/214.JPG" alt=""><br>Here's a strange urinal I saw in Paris. &nbsp;You stand INSIDE the urinal, but your feet stay clean!<br><br><br><img src="images/France/Paris/217.JPG" alt=""><br>This
is my first meal in France. &nbsp;Lots of creamy chicken. &nbsp;Wine
too. &nbsp;It seems typically a restaurant will hack up one baguette
and put it in a basket for you. &nbsp;I've had hacked-up baguette in
other French restaurants too. &nbsp;Also important in this picture is
the Paris map. &nbsp;Study it well! &nbsp;My first half hour in Paris
was spent figuring out the location of the train station I started out
at.<br><br><br><img src="images/France/Paris/218.JPG" alt=""><br>Greek architecture looks best at night.<br><br><br><img src="images/France/Paris/289.JPG" alt=""><br>Gothic
architecture looks best at night too, but I wasn't about to sit around
and wait for nightfall here. &nbsp;This is the Notre Dame cathedral.
&nbsp;If you haven't seen The Hunchback of Notre Dame, I suggest you
do. &nbsp;Good movie, and it will make you appreciate this cathedral
all the more.<br><br><br><img src="images/France/Paris/290.JPG" alt=""><br>Above
the archway are sculptures that tell the stories of the Bible.
&nbsp;Back in the day, people were not as literate, and these were
sculpted to let them learn the stories in spite of that.
&nbsp;Christian leaders universally agree that they are still needed
today, citing many examples of emails, forum posts, and blogs on the
internet as proof of illiteracy.<br><br><br><img src="images/France/Paris/304.JPG" alt=""><br>Okay,
okay, I DID wait till night. &nbsp;Here's Notre Dame at night.
&nbsp;The famous "flying buttresses" are visible here. &nbsp;Basically
it was just one innovation within a long line of innovations in
cathedral architecture. &nbsp;I personally like how it makes the
cathedral look like a giant dinosaur skeleton, complete with rib cage.
&nbsp;Christian leaders might point out that they're elegant and
beautiful. &nbsp;I hate to break it to them, but no one normally
considers a rib cage to be a work of art.<br><br><br><img src="images/France/Paris/291.JPG" alt=""><br>There
are so many buildings in Paris that would be suitable as the sole
tourist attraction of a smaller city. &nbsp;Paris doesn't share its
buildings though. &nbsp;It hoards them. &nbsp;Very rude.<br><br><br><img src="images/France/Paris/305.JPG" alt=""><br>Notre
Dame was closed, so I consoled myself with this hot dog/french fry
munchie. &nbsp;I like how you eat it all at once. &nbsp;Reminds me of
"Fat Cats" at Rutgers.<br><br><br><img src="images/France/Paris/306.JPG" alt=""><br>As
I was waiting to meet up with Gilras, a couchsurfer who I was going to
have a beer with in Paris (Around 8-9pm, well after closing hours), the
doors of Notre Dame opened. &nbsp;A cross started flashing eerily.
&nbsp;I saw a bluish white cloud floating over it. &nbsp;I heard eerie
music too. &nbsp;Apparently Notre Dame was trying to bait people to
walk in and watch a movie while being harassed for donations. &nbsp;I
definitely wanted to check it out, so when Gilras showed up, we walked
in. &nbsp;The movie was supposed to be about the origins and
construction of Notre Dame, but instead, the movie was mostly about the
Bible. &nbsp;We left after 10 minutes.<br><br><br><img src="images/France/Paris/363.JPG" alt=""><br>This
fancy building is the Palace of Justice, which serves as a courthouse.
&nbsp;If your wine is not up to code, people here will incarcerate you.<br><br><br><img src="images/France/Paris/364.JPG" alt=""><br>The French apparently like Japanese animation. &nbsp;This is for my anime-loving friends who are actually reading this.<br><br><br><img src="images/France/Paris/366.JPG" alt=""><br>More
flashy buildings. &nbsp;I think I was a bit lost when I took this
picture. &nbsp;Fortunately, in most cities, I find they have a lot of
"You are here" maps, so even if you are incapable of using your own
map, you still might find your way back some day.<br><br><br><img src="images/France/Paris/367.JPG" alt=""><br>Ferme
means "closed". &nbsp;I learned this when I reached the Pantheon.
&nbsp;See that dude blocking the opening in the fence? &nbsp;He taught
me that.<br><br><br><img src="images/France/Paris/368.JPG" alt=""><br>I
went to a beer-friendly restaurant. &nbsp;It was at this restaurant
where I met the rudest Parisians of all Parisians. &nbsp;I tried to
ignore his rudeness. &nbsp;Looking on the menu, I was enthralled with
the selection of French beers. &nbsp;In fact, this was the first time I
considered the existence of French beer. &nbsp;Till then, I guess my
subconscious assumed they identified with Belgian beer, and that would
be good enough.<br><br><br><img src="images/France/Paris/371.JPG" alt=""><br>This
beer, a Faro Lambic beer, is not sold outside of Belgium and France,
from what I hear. &nbsp;I certainly have looked all over for it in the
US, with no success. &nbsp;It's made from sugarcane but is not overly
sweet. &nbsp;Tastes really good!<br><br><br><img src="images/France/Paris/372.JPG" alt=""><br>I got another chopped up baguette, a garden salad (much like&nbsp;garden salads in the US), and a leek quiche.<br><br><br><img src="images/France/Paris/374.JPG" alt=""><br>For
the main meal, I ate this duck on little potato pieces. &nbsp;It was a
lot greasier than I'm used to. &nbsp;You can actually see the potato
pieces swimming in the grease on the plate. &nbsp;The tomato cheese
thing was nice. &nbsp;It was in general a very good meal, but I decided
long ago that the Italians are the best at food.<br><br><br><img src="images/France/Paris/375.JPG" alt=""><br>This was taken as I was trying to find my way back to the Seine River. &nbsp;This street looked very European.<br><br><br><img src="images/France/Paris/377.JPG" alt=""><br>As I neared the river, I saw this wonderful fountain with some hip-hop dancers showing their moves in front of it.<br><br><br><img src="images/France/Paris/379.JPG" alt=""><img src="images/France/Paris/380.JPG" alt=""><br>It looked like this guy had something crawling up his pants. &nbsp;That to me is the pinnacle of a successful performance.<br><br><br><br><img src="images/France/Paris/381.JPG" alt=""><br>Another soldier on a very immobile horse.<br><br><br><img src="images/France/Paris/384.JPG" alt=""><br>The
Seine River as night approached was one of those dreamy scenes that
will stay with me forever. &nbsp;As usual, no picture I take is going
to do it justice. &nbsp;I'd say you have to be there, but I don't think
Parisians deserve your business.<br><br><br><img src="images/France/Paris/402.JPG" alt=""><br>This
is not the famous Arch of Triumph. &nbsp;There is a path that leads
directly from this arch (near the Louvre) to the Arch of Triumph.
&nbsp;This path perhaps is open during parades or whatever, but at
night, it certainly was not. &nbsp;However, that tiny square thing lit
up in the distance that you can see through this arch is the Arch of
Triumph. &nbsp;I didn't necessarily know how obstructed at night the
path was from this arch to that one, so I decided to try to walk
straight there anyway. &nbsp;According to the book I read, I knew there
was a tunnel I eventually had to take to get to the arch, to avoid
traffic surrounding it. &nbsp;I love diving into the unknown. &nbsp;The yellowbrick road awaits!<br><br><br><img src="images/France/Paris/405.JPG" alt=""><br>Here's
a big ol' obelisk, just like I saw all over Rome. &nbsp;I guess France
got into the obelisk game too. &nbsp;I can easily see the Louvre
wanting to show that it could have obelisks if it wanted to.<br><br><br><img src="images/France/Paris/414.JPG" alt=""><br>I
had to go around something that looked like a miniature central park,
guarded with an iron fence. &nbsp;I made it to the main road leading to
the Arch of Triumph. &nbsp;Along the way, I saw a lot of military
things being displayed. &nbsp;Looks like it was a French aerospace
industry street fair.<br><br><br><img src="images/France/Paris/408.JPG" alt=""><br>You can't see it, but this one was labeled the "Eurocopter". &nbsp;Just adorable.<br><br><br><img src="images/France/Paris/409.JPG" alt=""><br>Here was an unmanned aerial vehicle and its launcher. &nbsp;This is the type of plane Europe would spy on you with.<br><br><br><img src="images/France/Paris/410.JPG" alt=""><br>Some sort of radar/satellite dish/basketball backboard.<br><br><br><img src="images/France/Paris/415.JPG" alt=""><br>This looks like either the inside of a space station, a space vehicle,
a moon base, or a Mars base. &nbsp;It could also be where they quarantine
people who fall victim to American fast food.<br><br><br><img src="images/France/Paris/412.JPG" alt=""><br>I
see it says "control suite" in there. &nbsp;I assume if you were stuck
in a space station, you can use this to wave a robotic arm at your
loved ones.<br><br><br><img src="images/France/Paris/413.JPG" alt=""><br>Last time I saw something like this, it was at a really extravagant art festival in Coconut Grove in Florida.<br><br><br><img src="images/France/Paris/416.JPG" alt=""><br>I
finally made it to the Arch of Triumph. &nbsp;The arch stays open
pretty late. &nbsp;The traffic surrounding it never seems to let up.
&nbsp;It's a six lane traffic circle that you have little chance of
crossing without help. &nbsp;That help came in the form of the
aforementioned tunnel. &nbsp;When under the arch, I saw a guy lie on
his back and take a picture. &nbsp;I did the same thing and saw this.<br><br><br><img src="images/France/Paris/417.JPG" alt=""><br>I looked up and saw the undersides of all the 284 steps I would get to climb.<br><br><br><img src="images/France/Paris/418.JPG" alt=""><br>For me, at least for now, 284 steps is no big deal. &nbsp;Here's the inside of the top of the arch.<br><br><br><img src="images/France/Paris/419.JPG" alt=""><br>They
had a little model of the arch, and a gift shop. &nbsp;I didn't really
like French souvenir shops. &nbsp;I bought a wooden plate at one shop,
but not this one.<br><br><br><img src="images/France/Paris/420.JPG" alt=""><br>Behold,
la Tour d'Eiffel! &nbsp;That's about all of my French. &nbsp;Two
spotlights swing around on the top of the Eiffel Tower, so at night in
Paris, you can always look up and see how to find it. &nbsp;Lots of
colors though in the "City of Lights". &nbsp;The way the Eiffel Tower
lights up with dark blue looks very surreal.<br><br><br><img src="images/France/Paris/421.JPG" alt=""><br>I
took a picture this way too. &nbsp;leading back to were the Louvre
would be. &nbsp;I can't tell if I can see the Louvre or not, but I can
see that one building on the left that was changing its color
repeatedly, trying to look good for the camera. &nbsp;In this picture,
it was purple. &nbsp;I honestly don't know how impressive this would
have seemed if not for the Eiffel Tower and the purple building.<br><br><br><img src="images/France/Paris/431.JPG" alt=""><br>Here's all the stairs I had to walk heading back down... You are getting sleepy. &nbsp;Verrrry sleeeeeeepy...<br><br><br><img src="images/France/Paris/433.JPG" alt=""><br>Around the base of the Arch of Triumph was France's tomb of the unknown soldier for the First World War.<br><br><br><img src="images/France/Paris/435.JPG" alt=""><br>I
saw this and said, "I'll have a Napoleon!" &nbsp;You can imagine they
don't call it that in&nbsp;France. &nbsp;Instead, I had to point like a
monkey and flash money to acquire my prize. &nbsp;I later learned they
call this "mille feuille". &nbsp;Trust me; if you don't know French,
don't bother trying to pronounce that.<br><br><br><img src="images/France/Paris/436.JPG" alt=""><br>Here's
a speedy TGV train. &nbsp;The quality of the train tracks in France is
apparent when you stare at them from inside the train. &nbsp;Then
again, I'm not a mechanical engineer, so maybe I don't know what I'm
looking at. &nbsp;It seemed the rest of the ground rushed by while the
train track remained a perfectly still straight line.<br><br><br><img src="images/France/Paris/525.JPG" alt=""><br>Here's a view of another train station in Paris. &nbsp;Thought it looked cool.<br><br><br><br><br><a href="versailles.html">Versailles</a><br><br><a href="louvre.html">Louvre</a><br><br><br><br><a href="index.html">Back</a><br></div></body></html>
