French train system is fast, but the real benefit is the view.
&nbsp;Don't you hate it when you're on a train, and you're going to
take a picture of a really nice&nbsp;view, then you pass by some trees
and your view is gone? &nbsp;Well that happened to me about thirty
times on this train. &nbsp;The passengers sitting near me must have
wondered if I was just pretending to be a photographer or something.
&nbsp;Well, this is the best picture I could get, but if you're ever on
the train heading through southern France, I suggest you look out for a
gorgeous castle on a mountain and take pictures of that. &nbsp;I will
admit that the aesthetics of this country really put New Jersey to
shame.<br><br><br><img src="images/France/Lille/488.JPG" alt=""><br>I
met Francois on the ride up north. &nbsp;He at first made a French joke
to me, and regretted it soon after, when he heard me say "Parlay voo
anglay?" &nbsp;He did know enough English for us to have a good
conversation. &nbsp;He actually knew about couchsurfing and I told him
I'd be up for showing him around if he ever visits the northeast.
&nbsp;We had someone take our picture, although with the bright window
behind us, our faces came out dark. &nbsp;A seemingly grumpy man nearby
shouted "Use the flash! &nbsp;Contra-jour!" at me. &nbsp;Contra-jour is
a term that translates to "against day". &nbsp;The camera will adjust
to the sun's brightness, but if you use the flash, then foreground
subjects are adequately brightened as well.<br><br><br><img src="images/France/Lille/490.JPG" alt=""><br>To
the right is Contra-jour Man who turned out to have a very affable
personality. &nbsp;He'd make a good James Bond villain. &nbsp;To the
left is Patty. &nbsp;The French seemed to have a weird tradition.
&nbsp;Either they brought no food and just bought food on the train, or
they brought a heap of junk food with them. &nbsp;Note that none of
this junk food is from McDonald's. &nbsp;I just find a heap of junk
food nauseating. &nbsp;Here's Patty and Contra-jour Man posing with
some jelly beans.<br><br><br><img src="images/France/Lille/491.JPG" alt=""><br>I
arrived in Lille. &nbsp;Actually, my host was in Lomme, near Lille.
&nbsp;I went from the very southern edge of France all the way to
the&nbsp;very north. &nbsp;When I got up there, I didn't see my host
that was supposed to meet up with me. &nbsp;I called and left a
message. &nbsp;It did make me a bit worried, but I found an internet
cafe and tried to get in touch with her then. &nbsp;Using a French
keyboard is really annoying by the way. &nbsp;Worst case scenario, I
would have found my way over to a hostel or even hotel if I needed to,
but I was confident someone would come get me.<br><br><br><img src="images/France/Lille/492.JPG" alt=""><br>A
few minutes later, Marc showed up at the subway station. &nbsp;My host,
Moira (pronounced Moy-ha, of Gaelic origin), was hosted by him in
Recife, Brazil, and was hosting him in return. &nbsp;They got along...
very well. &nbsp;Moira has two children, Yvan and Elouan. &nbsp;They
both have a silly amount of energy.<br><br><br><img src="images/France/Lille/493.JPG" alt=""><br>We
made our way to a restaurant in Lille the next day. &nbsp;Moira's on
the left, Marc's on the right. &nbsp;Her kids are chained to the wall
off-camera.<br><br><br><img src="images/France/Lille/494.JPG" alt=""><br>Above one of the train stations is this glass pyramid fountain. &nbsp;You can look up through it from inside the station.<br><br><br><img src="images/France/Lille/495.JPG" alt=""><br>Buildings
in Lille don't really compare with buildings in Paris. &nbsp;However,
that's what tourists do. &nbsp;They take pictures of buildings.<br><br><br><img src="images/France/Lille/496.JPG" alt=""><br>Here's
a whole lot of buildings in the center of Lille. &nbsp;I think the lady
atop that pillar is actually holding a riding crop and not a sword.<br><br><br><img src="images/France/Lille/497.JPG" alt=""><br>Here's a view of Moira as she pushes one of her children into the fountain.<br><br><br><img src="images/France/Lille/498.JPG" alt=""><br>Old newspapers were for sale in the old courthouse, dating back to the 19th century.<br><br><br><img src="images/France/Lille/499.JPG" alt=""><br>There were all sorts of things for sale here. &nbsp;Mainly books, but also old trinkets as well.<br><br><br><img src="images/France/Lille/500.JPG" alt=""><br>This building advertises "Opera de Lille". &nbsp;We didn't see any opera though.<br><br><br><img src="images/France/Lille/501.JPG" alt=""><br>This is the closest you'll get to Big Ben in Lille.<br><br><br><img src="images/France/Lille/502.JPG" alt=""><br>Why
should men who like porn stare down in shame? &nbsp;Well, with
mannequins lying underground like this, we'd be happy to. &nbsp;If only
all mannequins looked this hot.<br><br><br><img src="images/France/Lille/503.JPG" alt=""><br>This is a colorful real estate building.<br><br><br><img src="images/France/Lille/504.JPG" alt=""><br>One
thing I liked a lot about Lille was the Dutch influence. &nbsp;See the
step-like design atop the buildings? &nbsp;Very Dutch.<br><br><br><img src="images/France/Lille/505.JPG" alt=""><br>Nothing wrong with painting your building orange in Lille.<br><br><br><img src="images/France/Lille/506.JPG" alt=""><br>The
kids were with us the whole time. &nbsp;They definitely were a handful.
&nbsp;We found a fenced off area with a small locked door. &nbsp;It was
a good time to let the kids play while we took a breather. &nbsp;Here
Elouan is testing the door. &nbsp;This reminded me of Alice in
Wonderland.<br><br><br><img src="images/France/Lille/508.JPG" alt=""><br>Here's a front shot of Yvan and Elouan, partners in crime.<br><br><br><img src="images/France/Lille/510.JPG" alt=""><br>Lille was fairly scenic.<br><br><br><img src="images/France/Lille/511.JPG" alt=""><br>More
rest for us while the hooligans raid the playground. &nbsp;While
walking around, Elouan started to ascend up the ledge of a fenced off
ramp. &nbsp;He clung to the fence, getting higher and higher, until I
was just about the only one who could reach him safely. &nbsp;I
recognized this and pulled the bugger off the fence, very carefully,
and eventually he was safe n' sound. &nbsp;One day, when Elouan's
insanely wealthy, I'm going to repeat this story to him and collect my reward.<br><br><br><img src="images/France/Lille/512.JPG" alt=""><br>This
is a rather embarrassing picture. &nbsp;First, I'll talk more about the
two additional companions here. &nbsp;To the far right is Elodie, who
was another couchsurfer host who was up for showing me around. &nbsp;To
the left next to me is her friend. &nbsp;I can't remember his name
though. &nbsp;He was fun to hang out with as well. &nbsp;Now for the
embarrassing part. &nbsp;So Marc told me to make a gang sign with my
hand. &nbsp;I totally screwed it up. &nbsp;I did the peace sign.
&nbsp;You can see Marc looking over at me, in obvious amusement.<br><br><br><img src="images/France/Lille/513.JPG" alt=""><br>So
now it was just me, Elodie, and her friend. &nbsp;We looked at a map
and decided to seek out the citadel in the northwest corner of Lille.
&nbsp;All of us were pretty bad with directions.<br><br><br><img src="images/France/Lille/514.JPG" alt=""><br>We did make it though! &nbsp;All it takes is some perseverance and application of common sense. &nbsp;Maps really do work. &nbsp;We knew were were near the citadel when we saw foliage. &nbsp;According to the map, there would be foliage there.<br><br><br><img src="images/France/Lille/515.JPG" alt=""><br>I
hope this tree's family never sees what happened here. &nbsp;The
carving did look cool though. &nbsp;"Une maison pour tous" means "a
house for all". &nbsp;There's a zoo nearby too, but we didn't go there.<br><br><br><img src="images/France/Lille/516.JPG" alt=""><br>We
arrived at the citadel. &nbsp;I had incredible trouble pronouncing
citadel at the time, providing no end to entertainment for my friends.
&nbsp;Elodie was trying to teach me a bit of French at the time too.
&nbsp;She said my rolled R's sounded like a barking dog. &nbsp;Maybe a
French one though.<br><br><br><img src="images/France/Lille/517.JPG" alt=""><br>The
water was coated with these green specks. &nbsp;I think they're seeds
of some sort, but it looked surreal so I took a picture.<br><br><br><img src="images/France/Lille/518.JPG" alt=""><br>This one too. &nbsp;It might not look that good from a distance. &nbsp;Who'd want to swim in a guacamole river? <br><br><br><img src="images/France/Lille/520.JPG" alt=""><br>We
turned to head back, but we realized we didn't know exactly where we
were. &nbsp;The citadel didn't have roads near it, although eventually
we'd find a major road by walking away from it. &nbsp;That's what we
did. &nbsp;We crossed a bridge and headed down a main road, hoping to
find a way to cross back towards central Lille. &nbsp;It was difficult
to find where to cross back over from, and due to the time&nbsp;of day,
we decided to head further away and take a bus back. &nbsp;We strayed
into the town of St. Andreas. &nbsp;I took a picture of it because I
realized very few Americans would ever stray here.<br><br><br><img src="images/France/Lille/521.JPG" alt=""><br>We
parted ways and I headed back to Moira's place. &nbsp;I realized not
too many Americans visit Lomme either, so I took a picture of the Lomme
sign. &nbsp;The other side says "Lille".<br><br><br><img src="images/France/Lille/522.JPG" alt=""><br>I
sat down for a last meal with my last host, and helped myself to the
Camembert cheese. &nbsp;I cut sideways, like on the bottom, but the
proper way to cut the cheese is like a wedge as shown on top.
&nbsp;Moira was shaking her head, saying that I never learned how to
cut Camembert cheese, giggling to herself. &nbsp;I decided to take a
picture, but not before Elouan scarred the cheese across the middle.<br><br><br><img src="images/France/Lille/524.JPG" alt=""><br>By
the way, Moira had a cat too. &nbsp;You might imagine this cat has a
rough life with the kids running around, but he really knew how to
handle them. &nbsp;He just kept his distance, and the kids did the
same. &nbsp;He must have taken some swipes at them in the past, because
they seemed to have learned their lesson. &nbsp;By the way, the cat was
hungry and dinner was going to be served.<br><br><br><img src="images/France/Lille/523.JPG" alt=""><br>Spaghetti
and ground beef was the cat's favorite, apparently. &nbsp;This cat
repeated his mischief very reliably, so I was able to get him on
camera, before he got shooed away again.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><a href="index.html">Back</a><br></div></body></html>
