<img src="images/Ireland/Hawth/085.JPG" alt=""><br>Andrea, Vanessa,
Yoavick and I wanted to explore the Irish countryside. &nbsp;On
someone's recommendation, we went to a town not too far away by train.
&nbsp;Here they had fudge. &nbsp;If I saw the "You choose 4"
advertisement in the camera, I may have bought some fudge.<br><br><br><img src="images/Ireland/Hawth/092.JPG" alt=""><br>Howth, right alongside the Irish sea, had a popular marina. &nbsp;I was just taking a picture of the bird though.<br><br><br><img src="images/Ireland/Hawth/094.JPG" alt=""><br>We
think these were sea lions that swam up to see the tourist zoo.
&nbsp;Apparently they wanted fudge bars, but we didn't buy any.<br><br><br><img src="images/Ireland/Hawth/086.JPG" alt=""><br>This sea lion was upset and went back home.<br><br><br><img src="images/Ireland/Hawth/089.JPG" alt=""><br>Are you sure you can't spare a fudge bar?<br><br><br><img src="images/Ireland/Hawth/091.JPG" alt=""><br>No fudge bar :(<br><br><br><img src="images/Ireland/Hawth/095.JPG" alt=""><br>Here's a lighthouse designed to make this picture more interesting.<br><br><br><img src="images/Ireland/Hawth/099.JPG" alt=""><br>I
saw this plane fly overhead. &nbsp;After loading it up, I noticed the
Aer Lingus clover on the tail. &nbsp;That's the main Irish airline.<br><br><br><img src="images/Ireland/Hawth/100.JPG" alt=""><br>A few motorboats sped around.<br><br><br><img src="images/Ireland/Hawth/101.JPG" alt=""><br>Daisies along the Irish sea.<br><br><br><img src="images/Ireland/Hawth/106.JPG" alt=""><br>I
always try to get at least one shot with a sailboat with its sails both
down. &nbsp;Most of them only used one sail or just turned on the
motor. &nbsp;I assume that little tower lights up on top, because it's
a pretty low height for an observation deck. &nbsp;Maybe they put it
there to help people escape from bears.<br><br><br><img src="images/Ireland/Hawth/107.JPG" alt=""><br>Here's a wall with steps for&nbsp;people to sit on and stare at the pretty sailboat and silly observation deck.<br><br><br><img src="images/Ireland/Hawth/111.JPG" alt=""><br>Although
we were not in France, I wanted a crepe and did not want to wait any
longer. &nbsp;We found this emergency crepe-injection station.<br><br><br><img src="images/Ireland/Hawth/114.JPG" alt=""><br>In a real emergency, you could go with the heavy artillery. &nbsp;Not good for you though.<br><br><br><img src="images/Ireland/Hawth/115.JPG" alt=""><br>This
isn't the best picture of me, but everyone else looked good so I took
the bullet for them. &nbsp;I was happy with my crepe though, so who
cares?<br><br><br><img src="images/Ireland/Hawth/116.JPG" alt=""><br>At
this moment, I was saying I really wanted to hear some Irish music.
&nbsp;This man eavesdropped and heard this, proceeding to take out his
fiddle and get to work.<br><br><br><img src="images/Ireland/Hawth/118.JPG" alt=""><br>I
saw this amazing-sounding Bailey's ice cream in an ice cream store we
went to. &nbsp;All of us wanted the Bailey's ice cream, but it just
looked so plain. &nbsp;I bought Pooh-bear ice cream instead. &nbsp;The
others joked that I was eating poo :(<br><br><br><img src="images/Ireland/Hawth/119.JPG" alt=""><br>This looks nice, but it actually reminds me of Sandy Hook in New Jersey. &nbsp;Not really a gold standard.<br><br><br><img src="images/Ireland/Hawth/121.JPG" alt=""><br>Okay, a palm tree. &nbsp;I've seen some paintings that looked like this, so I was getting happier.<br><br><br><img src="images/Ireland/Hawth/124.JPG" alt=""><br>Hey, check out the house on the rolling green hill with the castle wall along the Irish sea! &nbsp;Now we're talking!<br><br><br><img src="images/Ireland/Hawth/126.JPG" alt=""><br>A small island floats by...<br><br><br><img src="images/Ireland/Hawth/128.JPG" alt=""><br>Here's a shot that gives much better coverage of this guy's property.<br><br><br><img src="images/Ireland/Hawth/130.JPG" alt=""><br>You can see the marina and the house.<br><br><br><img src="images/Ireland/Hawth/132.JPG" alt=""><br>Vanessa did not want to hike any further, so she convinced us she could have fun here.<br><br><br><img src="images/Ireland/Hawth/133.JPG" alt=""><br>We
made it to the top of the hill we were climing up. &nbsp;Seeing water
from higher up isn't very special, but the moss was cool &nbsp;This
picture was from partway up, like the others so far..<br><br><br><img src="images/Ireland/Hawth/134.JPG" alt=""><br>This boat no doubt was trying to smuggle Guinness out of the country.<br><br><br><img src="images/Ireland/Hawth/136.JPG" alt=""><br>This sign, if you observe closely, warns you that you can fall off cliffs.<br><br><br><img src="images/Ireland/Hawth/138.JPG" alt=""><br>Finally
we reached the top. &nbsp;I took a picture of where Vanessa was
sitting. &nbsp;You can see someone dressed in black sitting on the edge
there. &nbsp;That's her!<br><br><br><img src="images/Ireland/Hawth/146.JPG" alt=""><br>I decided to test out my camera's zoom on Vanessa, to prove to you it really might be her.<br><br><br><img src="images/Ireland/Hawth/139.JPG" alt=""><br>Falling would have been bad. &nbsp;Looked scarier in person, with hungry birds overhead.<br><br><br><img src="images/Ireland/Hawth/141.JPG" alt=""><br>This is the most expansive view you're going to get of Howth. &nbsp;It's better than that silly observation deck.<br><br><br><img src="images/Ireland/Hawth/142.JPG" alt=""><br>I
took a picture of Andrea taking a picture. &nbsp;Andrea was also shy
about having her picture taken. &nbsp;She focuses very intensely
though, and called this a "sneaky" shot. &nbsp;I assure you, I did not
use zoom for this picture. &nbsp;I just held the camera in front of her
face and snapped a picture. &nbsp;A ninja I am not.<br><br><br><img src="images/Ireland/Hawth/144.JPG" alt=""><br>Here's Yoav reaching the top too.<br><br><br><img src="images/Ireland/Hawth/149.JPG" alt=""><br>We
watched the water rhythmically wash over the rocks down below.
&nbsp;Little seagulls sat in the water, enjoying the bumpy waves.
&nbsp;The two white spots to the left are seagulls.<br><br><br><img src="images/Ireland/Hawth/151.JPG" alt=""><br>The
way the sun hit the rocks was stunning in person. &nbsp;You have to see
it in person. &nbsp;Or you can just look at this picture.<br><br><br><img src="images/Ireland/Hawth/154.JPG" alt=""><br>The rocks were decorated with yellow and green splotches.<br><br><br><img src="images/Ireland/Hawth/155.JPG" alt=""><br>Down this slope, the colors looked amazing.<br><br><br><img src="images/Ireland/Hawth/157.JPG" alt=""><br>Here's
me using my digital macro zoom on little flowers again. &nbsp;My
friends did not wait up for me as I tried to take this picture in a
strong breeze.<br><br><br><img src="images/Ireland/Hawth/158.JPG" alt=""><br>You can see how the water stains the rocks with that yellow tinge.<br><br><br><img src="images/Ireland/Hawth/160.JPG" alt=""><br>I
saw someone walking a West Highland White Terrier along the way.
&nbsp;I grew up with one, so I took a picture. &nbsp;I quizzed the
owner to see if she really owned the westie, or if the westie was
kidnapped. &nbsp;I asked, "Does he or does he not sniff crotches?"
&nbsp;She said he does, so I knew the westie was with her owner.<br><br><br><img src="images/Ireland/Hawth/162.JPG" alt=""><br>We
saw this nice man, Martin, on the way. &nbsp;The ladies with me thought
he looked too cute. &nbsp;I asked if he'd pose for a picture with them.
&nbsp;It was a very happy day for him.<br><br><br><img src="images/Ireland/Hawth/163.JPG" alt=""><br>On
the bus ride back to Dublin, I got Martin's address so I could send
these pictures to him. &nbsp;I haven't yet, but I will. &nbsp;We had
fun conversation. &nbsp;He was into numerology and all sorts of other
interesting hobbies.<br><br><br>
