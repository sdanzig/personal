		The scenery was stunning throughout the trail. While we had trouble finding copper mines, we were temporarily sated by hypnotic landscapes such as this one.

		The trail designer was smart enough to have this mine readily accessible, so people who couldn't find the other mines wouldn't get upset. However, we were still upset because they put a lock on the gate.

		And after a bit of painstaking climbing on my part, then a bit more climbing in the correct direction, we found this behemoth pit that leads into the copper mine from above, compliments of a crapload of dynamite.
