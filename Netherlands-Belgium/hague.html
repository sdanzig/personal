We did a quick excursion to Madurodam and The Hague for the daylight hours of the day before leaving for Brussels.  Madurodam was recommended to me by my boss, and I learned that we'd pass through The Hague getting to it.  I liked the idea of seeing the home of an international court, so I was all up for visiting The Hague too.<br>

<img src="images/hague/hague_01.jpg"><br>Bicycles are popular throughout the Netherlands, and all of Europe as far as I know.  Picture this parking lot as a huge mall parking lot, except with 5 bikes for every car.  This picture doesn't do it justice.  Lots of bicycles, in other words.<br><br><br>
<img src="images/hague/hague_02.jpg"><br>Cool abstract art.  I took pictures whenever I thought something looked intriguing, in addition to when Miller was impressed.<br><br><br>
<img src="images/hague/hague_03.jpg"><br>We spotted this sign around The Hague, and figured it was worth snapping a picture at.<br><br><br>
<img src="images/hague/hague_04.jpg"><br>A statue with a birdie on top.  A master's photography in action.<br><br><br>
<img src="images/hague/hague_05.jpg"><br>A Dutch black ladybug with red spots.  Yes, it's backwards.<br><br><br>
<img src="images/hague/hague_06.jpg"><br>An impressive, large, detailed painting in one of The Hague's art museums.<br><br><br>
<img src="images/hague/hague_07.jpg"><br>The Hague had a peaceful lake that you could fish bikes out of.  Apparently city employees were actually doing that.<br><br><br>
<img src="images/hague/hague_08.jpg"><br>Here's another painting in the museum we stopped at.<br><br><br>
<img src="images/hague/hague_09.jpg"><br>This painting looked nasty enough to capture in a photo. See a corpse's arm get disected.<br><br><br>
<img src="images/hague/hague_10.jpg"><br>Random archway in The Hague.<br><br><br>
<img src="images/hague/hague_11.jpg"><br>This building was the precursor to the Netherlands's Second Parliament building on a tour.  The Parliament building which we werne't allowed to take pictures of was much more impressive.<br><br><br>
<img src="images/hague/hague_12.jpg"><br>Outdoor flea market in The Hague.  The difference about this flea market is that it catered to much wealthier people.<br><br><br>
<img src="images/hague/hague_13.jpg"><br>A random canal in The Hague<br><br><br>
<img src="images/hague/hague_14.jpg"><br><img src="images/hague/hague_15.jpg"><br><img src="images/hague/hague_16.jpg"><br>Walking back to The Hague's train station, we encountered these deer, just sitting out to relax and be looked at.  We looked at them.  There was an aviary there too.  All free, all for public viewing.  Kind of nice.<br><br><br>
<img src="images/hague/hague_17.jpg"><br>A splendid shot of buildings in The Hague.<br><br><br>
<img src="images/hague/hague_18.jpg"><br>The best canal shot I could manage in The Hague.<br><br><br>
