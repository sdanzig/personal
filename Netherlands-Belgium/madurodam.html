I can only say so much about Madurodam.  It's basically miniature buildings with miniature people and cars, complete with miniature bridges and a miniature airport.  It was much less impressive than I was hoping, but it was still amusing to see. Madurodam is a miniature city consisting of famous structures throughout the Netherlands.  I took a couple of nice shots and will let you judge for yourself, although keep in mind it's less impressive in person.<br><br><br>
<img src="images/madurodam/madurodam_01.jpg"><br>This sign outside Madurodam was cool, and I got to see approximately how far, in kilometers, I was from home (near New York) at the moment.<br><br><br>
<img src="images/madurodam/madurodam_02.jpg"><br>Upon entering Madurodam, the first thing you see is this tiny anti-fire boat squirting out a miniature fire on a miniature oil tanker.<br><br><br>
<img src="images/madurodam/madurodam_03.jpg"><br>There's a sign near the entrance that points out this spot as being the best spot to take a picture of all of Madurodam.  I'm sure this picture has been taken before, and mine is no different.  So much for originality.<br><br><br>
<img src="images/madurodam/madurodam_04.jpg"><br>Here's miniature cows peacefully grazing the overgrown grass, about to be eaten by the gargantuan crow from hell.<br><br><br>
<img src="images/madurodam/madurodam_05.jpg"><br>Miniature soldiers form a miniature army, standing in columns opposite from the miniature tanks.  If I have to type miniature one more time, I'm going to bite my fingers off.  I type "tiny" from now on.<br><br><br>
<img src="images/madurodam/madurodam_06.jpg"><br>A miniaturIZED version of a very impressive church.  If you pay 10 eurocents, you see the little trail of tiny people scooting in and out of the building, as though they were being bought at a grocery store.<br><br><br>
<img src="images/madurodam/madurodam_07.jpg"><br>A giant Miller is about to wreak havoc upon the unsuspecting church, destroying some tiny dude's wedding.<br><br><br>
<img src="images/madurodam/madurodam_08.jpg"><br>Here's another nice view of buildings throughout Madurodam.  They really didn't look so impressive close up, but I'm sure someone spent a lot of time doing something, nonetheless.<br><br><br>
<img src="images/madurodam/madurodam_09.jpg"><br>The wavy handrail seemed to fit the theme of Madurodam, waviness.<br><br><br>
<img src="images/madurodam/madurodam_10.jpg"><br>In a building behind the whole min..err..tiny city, there was a building housing an exhibit of the ancient Dutch, and the way they lived.<br><br><br>
<img src="images/madurodam/madurodam_11.jpg"><br>I want my future house to look like this, except bigger.<br><br><br>
<img src="images/madurodam/madurodam_12.jpg"><br>You can see this tiny river was defiled with huge circular chunks of reflective metal alloys.<br><br><br>
<img src="images/madurodam/madurodam_13.jpg"><br>I didn't get a nice picture of a typical dutch windmill, so this will fit the bill.<br><br><br>
<img src="images/madurodam/madurodam_14.jpg"><br>A tiny picture of another tiny building.<br><br><br>
<img src="images/madurodam/madurodam_15.jpg"><br>This possibly is the most impressive-looking picture I took in Madurodam.  To the back and right, you can see the building you go through to enter Madurodam.<br><br><br>
<img src="images/madurodam/madurodam_16.jpg"><br>More representations of interesting buildings, surrounded by tiny cars.  Okay, I'm getting sick of the word "tiny" now.  I'll just type "small".<br><br><br>
<img src="images/madurodam/madurodam_17.jpg"><br>This fish was not small.<br><br><br>
<img src="images/madurodam/madurodam_18.jpg"><br>Here's a small version of a creatively designed bridge.  You get to walk across them Godzilla-style, and they actually bounce a bit.  Stomping may not have been a good idea, but I did not fear falling into the small chasm below.<br><br><br>
<img src="images/madurodam/madurodam_19.jpg"><br>These fish were quite rabid for bread crumbs.  I'm sure they get fed all the time.  They've evolved to climb to the surface when humans pass near.<br><br><br>
<img src="images/madurodam/madurodam_20.jpg"><br>Here was a nice Eindhoven building to take a picture of.<br><br><br>
<img src="images/madurodam/madurodam_21.jpg"><br>This is the miniature airport.  KLM is the major Dutch airline.<br><br><br>
<img src="images/madurodam/madurodam_22.jpg"><br>This was amusing.  You press buttons to make the car spin out at various spots throughout the track.<br><br><br>
<img src="images/madurodam/madurodam_23.jpg"><br>Pleasant-looking buildings line one of the small roads.  "Small" is pretty drab.  I'll go out with a bang and use "infinitesimal".<br><br><br>
<img src="images/madurodam/madurodam_24.jpg"><br>Just a pretty scene decorated with an infinitesimal bridge.  They hired a some hard working gardeners to take care of the infinitesimal plant life.<br><br><br>
<img src="images/madurodam/madurodam_25.jpg"><br>Here's a sculpture inspired by Gulliver's Travels that was lying near the door in the entry/exit building.<br><br><br>
<img src="images/madurodam/madurodam_26.jpg"><br>And finally we leave the miniature-laden Madurodam.  I figure I should take at least one tiny, infinitesimally small picture of the entrance before I go.<br><br><br>
