<p>Ricotta Cheese Pie</p>

<p>Crust:</p>
<ul>
  <li>2 c all-purpose flour</li>
  <li>1½ c butter, at room temperature but not soft</li>
  <li>4 egg yolks</li>
  <li>¼ c sugar</li>
  <li>3 tbsp dry marsala wine</li>
  <li>1 tsp freshly grated lemon peel. Dried grated lemon peel works too. You can find that in the spice section of the grocery store</li>
  <li>½ tsp salt</li>
</ul>

<p>Ricotta Filling:</p>
<ul>
  <li>2.5 lb ricotta cheese</li>
  <li>½ c sugar</li>
  <li>1 tbsp flour</li>
  <li>½ tsp salt</li>
  <li>1 tsp freshly grated orange peel (or dried grated orange peel)</li>
  <li>4 egg yolks. Save one egg white for the ingredient below.</li>
  <li>2 tbsp white raisins, rinsed and drained</li>
  <li>2 tbsp diced candied pineapple. Any sweet candied fruit will work. People make fruitcakes with candied fruit, so your grocery store should have them.</li>
  <li>2 tbsp slivered almonds</li>
  <li>1 egg white</li>
  <li>1 tbsp water</li>
</ul>
<p>
Making the crust (using only the crust ingredients):
</p>
<p>
Dump the flour into a large mixing bowl and make a large crater/well in the center of it.
Put the following into the crater:  butter, egg yolks, sugar, marsala wine, lemon peel and
salt. With your fingertips, mix the ingredients together, blending in as much of the flour
as you can manage. With the heels of your hands, work in the rest of the
flour until the dough is smooth. Do not knead the dough or work it any more than necessary.
If the dough is oily at all, refrigerate it until it is firm but not hard.
</p>
<p>
Pre-heat the oven to 350 F. Break off ¼ of the dough. Dust it lightly with flour and
leave in refrigerator, covered in plastic wrap.
</p>
<p>
Reshape the rest of the dough into a ball and place on a lightly floured board. With the
heel of your hand, flatten the ball into a 1 inch thick circle. Dust a little flour over
both sides to prevent the dough from sticking and begin rolling it out. Start from the
center with gentle pressure and roll to within an inch of the far edge then let the
rolling pin glide off the edge with no pressure. Gently lift the dough, turn clockwise,
and repeat rolling. Continue this until the circle is ? inches thick and 11 inches across.
If the dough sticks to the board while rolling, coat the front edge of a metal spatula
with flour and push the spatula firmly into the board while scraping under the stuck
dough.
</p>
<p>
Lightly butter the bottom and sides of a 9 by 1½ inch spring-form pan. Drape the dough
over the rolling pin, then hold the pin over the pan and unfold the dough over it.
Gently press the dough into the bottom and around the sides of the pan, taking care not
to stretch it. Roll the pin over the edge of the pan, pressing down hard to trim off the
excess dough around the top.
</p>
<p>
Bake crust until you see any sign of brown. Remove from oven.
</p>
<p>
Unwrap the remaining dough. Place it on a lightly floured board. Flatten it with the
heel of your hand and roll it into a rectangle about 12 inches long and 6 inches wide.
Cut into 12 strips, wiping the knife with a dry cloth and dipping it in flour between
each.
</p>
<br>
<p>
Making the ricotta filling:
</p>
<p>
Combine the ricotta cheese, sugar, 1 tbsp flour, salt, vanilla, orange peel, and egg
yolks in large bowl. Mix thoroughly. Stir in raisins and candied fruit. Spoon filling
into crust, smoothing it over with a rubber spatula (or the back of a large spoon).
Sprinkle filling with almonds, then criss-cross the strips of dough, 6 horizontal, 6
vertical, evenly spaced, weaving them together if you want. Clip off the excess dough
from the strips. Mix the egg white with the tbsp of water and brush the mixture over
the strips.
</p>
<br>
<p>
Baking:
</p>
<p>
Place the pie on the middle shelf of the oven and bake until the cheese starts
to brown. Start checking every 5 minutes after an hour, and don't let it cook
longer than 75 minutes. Place on wire rack and remove outside rim. Let it cool for
a while.
</p>
<br>
<p>
Serving:
</p>
<p>
If you serve it warm, it will be like the cheese in a cheese blintz. If you
serve it cold, it's practically cheesecake. Feel free to put fresh fruits like white
grapes.
