<p>Banana-Nut Bread</p>
<ul>
  <li>1<font face="Times New Roman">¼</font> c sugar</li>
  <li>
<font face="Times New Roman">½ c butter (1 stick), softened</font></li>
  <li>
<font face="Times New Roman">2 large eggs</font></li>
  <li>
<font face="Times New Roman">1½ c mashed very ripe bananas (Usually 3 large 
bananas will suffice. Make sure the bananas are covered with brown spots with a 
pungent banana scent.)</font></li>
  <li>
<font face="Times New Roman">½ c buttermilk (powdered buttermilk mix will work 
just fine)</font></li>
  <li>
<font face="Times New Roman">1 tsp vanilla extract</font></li>
  <li>
<font face="Times New Roman">2½ c all-purpose flour</font></li>
  <li>
<font face="Times New Roman">1 tsp baking soda</font></li>
  <li>
<font face="Times New Roman">1 tsp salt</font></li>
  <li>
<font face="Times New Roman">1 c coarsely chopped pecans</font></li>
</ul>
<p>Move oven rack to low position so that the tops of pans will be in the center 
of the oven. Heat oven to 350 F. Grease bottom only (I have forgotten before to 
only grease the bottom, so here's another reminder) of a 9 x 5 x 3 inch loaf pan 
with vegetable shortening.</p>
<p>Mix sugar and butter in a large bowl. Knead the butter with a spoon until the 
sugar and butter is of an even consistency and thoroughly mixed. Stir in eggs 
until well blended. Stir in bananas, buttermilk, and vanilla; beat until smooth. 
Stir in flour, baking soda and salt just until moistened. Stir in nuts. Pour 
batter evenly into pan.</p>
<p>Bake for about an hour then start checking every 5 minutes to see if a 
toothpick inserted into the center of the loaf comes out clean. Since this is a 
fairly thick loaf, you should pull the loaf out of the oven the moment it's 
ready. Otherwise, the outside might start to get overcooked and you might end up 
scraping off charred edges. Cool 10 minutes in pan on a wire rack then loosen 
sides of loaves with a butter knife and gently shake out of the pan, then wrap 
up tightly with plastic wrap and store in the refrigerator for 24 hours. This 
refrigeration helps strengthen the bread, so it won't crumble when you slice it. 
As a side note, it's also worth heating up a slice or two in the microwave (just 
until warm, no longer) and trying it that way.</p>
