<p>Turtle Brownies</p>
<ul>
  <li>4 squares unsweetened baking chocolate</li>
  <li>¾ c margarine</li>
  <li>2 c sugar</li>
  <li>4 eggs</li>
  <li>1 c flour</li>
  <li>1 pkg. (14 oz.) caramels, unwrapped - Kraft caramels are easy nicely packaged 
and easy to unwrap, but you can probably find a cheaper brand.</li>
  <li><font face="Times New Roman">&#8531;</font> c heavy cream</li>
  <li>2 c pecans, divided</li>
  <li>12 oz. of semi sweet chocolate baking bars, cut into
<font face="Times New Roman">¾</font> inch squares.</li>
</ul>
<p>Heat chocolate squares and margarine in a medium sauce pan on very low heat, 
stirring constantly until completely melted. Stir sugar into chocolate, mix in 
eggs, and then stir in flour just until fully mixed in. (Mixing extra decreases 
the density of the brownies.)&nbsp; Spread at least ½ of batter in a greased 
(melted butter/margarine, vegetable shortening, or Pam cooking spray is fine) 
13&quot; x 9&quot; baking pan, reserving the rest for the top layer. Bake at 350°F until 
it solidifies a bit, so you can spread other layers over it, but do not let it 
start to darken.&nbsp; The original recipe called for 25 minutes, but I find 
that it would get blackened long before that.</p>
<p>In a small sauce pan, over low heat, stir caramels and cream constantly until 
completely melted. Initially, you won't be able to easily stir a pile of sticky 
caramel blocks, but just get it to budge slightly back and forth and eventually 
it will melt enough for you to stir all the way around. Next, stir in 1 cup of 
pecans. Gently spread caramel mixture over brownie batter in pan, almost all the 
way to the edges.&nbsp; Don't worry if it does reach the edges, but note that 
the caramel tends to seep over a bit leaving a more chewy edge.</p>
<p>Sprinkle evenly with chocolate chunks. Pour remaining unbaked brownie batter 
evenly over caramel mixture and sprinkle with remaining pecans.</p>
<p>Bake an additional 30 minutes, checking every couple of minutes after 20.&nbsp; 
If you start to see the edges darken, it's probably ready and about to get 
overcooked.&nbsp; Cool in pan and run knife along edge of pan to loosen brownies 
out. </p>
