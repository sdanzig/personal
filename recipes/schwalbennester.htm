<p>Schwalbennester</p>
<ul>
  <li>1 lb veal; cut in 4 thin slices</li>
  <li>
<font face="Times New Roman">½</font> tsp salt</li>
  <li>
<font face="Times New Roman">&#8539;</font> tsp sugar</li>
  <li>
<font face="Times New Roman">½</font> tsp white pepper</li>
  <li>1 tbsp Dijon-style mustard</li>
  <li>4 strips of bacon (one per slice of veal)</li>
  <li>4 hard-boiled eggs, peeled.&nbsp; You're supposed to not over-boil them to avoid the 
yolk becoming gray, but I wouldn't worry too much about it.&nbsp; I find boiling 
an egg for about 9 minutes is fine, but you can judge for yourself.&nbsp;Whatever the case, if any white stuff starts to spurt out of the eggs, your eggs 
are done, and at least one of the egg whites is now deformed. To easily peel 
  after fully boiled, put the hot eggs in cold water.</li>
  <li>2 tbsp vegetable oil</li>
  <li>1 medium onion, diced</li>
  <li>
<font face="Times New Roman">¾</font> c beef bouillon; heated.&nbsp;You 
normally buy beef bouillon in jars of cheap little dry cubes from the soup aisle 
in the grocery store.</li>
  <li>1 tbsp tomato paste</li>
  <li>2 tbsp unbleached flour</li>
  <li>
<font face="Times New Roman">¼ </font>c&nbsp;red wine</li>
</ul>

<p>Dry veal on paper towels.&nbsp; Roll it in a mixture of salt, sugar, white 
pepper, and mustard.&nbsp; Place a bacon slice on top of each piece of veal.&nbsp; 
Place a whole egg on top of each slice of bacon.&nbsp; Rollup each slice of veal 
(jelly-roll fashion) and tie together with a string.&nbsp; Heat oil in a frying 
pan and brown veal rolls well on all sides.&nbsp; Add onion; sauté for 3 
minutes.&nbsp; Add the hot bouillon; cover and simmer gently 25 minutes.&nbsp; 
Remove the veal from the pan.&nbsp; Remove the strings from the veal and keep 
veal warm on a serving platter.&nbsp; Add tomato paste to the pan drippings; 
stir.&nbsp; Thoroughly mix flour and red wine to remove all lumps.&nbsp; Add to 
sauce and cook until mixture thickens.&nbsp; Add warm veal rolls and heat 
through.&nbsp; Before serving, place veal rolls on a platter, pour sauce over 
the rolls and serve with pureed potatoes.&nbsp; This dish is surprisingly easy 
to eat because you can cut through the egg and easily slice through the veal 
from the inside out.</p>
