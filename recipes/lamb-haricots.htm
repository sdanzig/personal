<p>Lamb-Haricots</p>
<ul>
  <li>1 lb assorted dried beans, such as Great Northern, flageolet, cranberry, and 
cannellini, picked over and rinsed.</li>
  <li>3 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil</li>
  <li>one 3 lb boneless lamb shoulder, cut into 6 pieces</li>
  <li>salt and freshly ground white pepper</li>
  <li>6 cloves garlic, peeled and split apart</li>
  <li>2 stalks celery, peeled, trimmed, and cut into 1 inch lengths</li>
  <li>1 onion, peeled, trimmed, and cut into 1 inch chunks</li>
  <li>1 fennel bulb, trimmed and cut lengthwise into quarters</li>
  <li>1 tbsp tomato paste</li>
  <li>5 large tomatoes, peeled, seeded, and finely chopped</li>
  <li>2 c dry white wine</li>
  <li>herb sachet, made by taking 10 sprigs of Italian parsley, 6 sprigs thyme, 2 
sprigs rosemary, 2 bay leaves, 1 branch fennel--reserved from the fennel 
bulb--and 1 teaspoon black peppercorns, all bagged and tied together with 
cheesecloth and twine.</li>
  <li>8 cups unsalted chicken stock.&nbsp; This can be made as directed below, or you 
can just buy low-sodium chicken broth from the store. You probably would want to 
store the remaining chicken stock for future use.&nbsp; You can store it at 
least a month in the freezer, as chicken broth often isn't made just for one 
use.</li>
</ul>
<p>Ingredients for homemade chicken stock:</p>
<ul>
  <li>4 lb chicken necks, backs, wings, or other chicken parts, skinned, fat trimmed, 
and rinsed</li>
  <li>2<font face="Times New Roman">½ gallons cold water (never use hot tap water)</font></li>
  <li><font face="Times New Roman">2 medium onions, peeled, trimmed, and cut into 
quarters</font></li>
  <li><font face="Times New Roman">2 small carrots, peeled, trimmed, and cut into 2 
inch pieces</font></li>
  <li><font face="Times New Roman">1 stalk celery, trimmed and cut into 2 inch pieces</font></li>
  <li><font face="Times New Roman">1 medium leek, trimmed, split lengthwise, and 
washed</font></li>
  <li><font face="Times New Roman">½ head garlic, split crosswise in half</font></li>
  <li><font face="Times New Roman">1 bay leaf</font></li>
  <li><font face="Times New Roman">5 sprigs Italian parsley, washed</font></li>
  <li><font face="Times New Roman">1 tsp white peppercorns</font></li>
</ul>
<p>Procedure for making homemade chicken stock:<br>
Put the chicken and 7 quarts of the cold water in a tall stockpot and bring to a 
rolling boil. Add the remaining 3 quarts water (it should be very cold) and skim 
off the fat that rises to the top. Adjust the heat so that the water simmers and 
let simmer for 10 minutes, skimming regularly.&nbsp; Add the remaining 
ingredients to the pot and simmer for three hours, continuing to skim so that 
the stock will be clear. Drain the stock in a colander. Allow the solids to 
drain for a few minutes before discarding them, then strain the stock through a 
fine mesh strainer. Let cool, then refrigerate.</p>
<p>Preparing the beans:<br>
Put the beans in a large pot and cover them with about three times their volume 
of cold water; allow the beans to soak overnight in the refrigerator. Drain and 
rinse the beans afterwards.</p>
<p>Cooking the lamb:<br>
Put a rack in the center of the oven and preheat to 325 F.</p>
<p>Warm the oil in a large skillet over medium heat. While it is heating, season 
the lamb all over with salt and pepper. Slip the lamb into the pan and brown the 
parts very well on all sides. When the lamb is deeply colored, transfer it to a 
large casserole dish and set aside. Pour off all but 2 to 3 tablespoons of the 
fat in the pan. Add the garlic, celery, onion, carrot, and fennel, season with 
salt and pepper, and cook, stirring, until the vegetables are translucent but 
not colored, about 10 minutes. Add the tomato paste and tomatoes and cook, 
stirring, until the tomatoes soften. Add the wine and simmer for about 5 
minutes, to burn off the alcohol and reduce the liquid by half. Transfer 
everything from the pan to the casserole dish and stire in the beans, herb 
sachet, and chicken stock.</p>
<p>Put the casserole dish over medium heat and bring the liquid to a simmer. Cut 
a sheet of parchment paper to fit inside the dish and cover the dish with the 
parchment paper lid and then put the casserole dish's own lid over that. Slide 
the dish into the oven and leave undisturbed for 2<font face="Times New Roman">½ 
hours, or until the meat is tender enough to be cut with a spoon. Check around 2 
hours into cooking. If it seems too dry, you can stir in up to 1 cup of water as 
it's cooking, as it should be kept moist and saucy. Discard the herb sachet and 
taste the beans; add more salt or pepper if needed.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">Serve from the casserole dish, topping a 
generous portion of the beans with a piece of the lamb.</font></p>
