<p>Coq au Vin</p>
<ul>
  <li>
<font face="Times New Roman">½ c all-purpose flour</font></li>
  <li>
<font face="Times New Roman">1 tsp salt</font></li>
  <li>
<font face="Times New Roman">¼ tsp pepper</font></li>
  <li>3 to 3<font face="Times New Roman">½</font> pound cut-up broiler-fryer chicken. 
If you're not sure how to cut up the chicken, just cut the thing down the middle 
with a pair of kitchen scissors, then remove the legs and a bit of meat with the 
wings and you'll get something close enough from there.</li>
  <li>8 slices bacon</li>
  <li>
<font face="Times New Roman">¾ c frozen small whole onions (from what usually is 
a 16 oz bag)</font></li>
  <li>3 c sliced mushrooms (8 oz)</li>
  <li>1 c chicken broth</li>
  <li>1 c dry red wine</li>
  <li>
<font face="Times New Roman">½ tsp salt</font></li>
  <li>4 medium (6-7 inch) carrots, cut into 2 inch pieces</li>
  <li>1 clove garlic, finely chopped</li>
  <li>a bouquet garni, which can be made by taking 1/2 teaspoon dried thyme leaves, 2 
large sprigs fresh parsley, and 1 bay leaf, wrapping it all in cheesecloth and 
tying it into a bag using a bit of twine. Make sure to appreciate the smell of 
the bay leaf :)</li>
</ul>
<p>Mix flour, 1 teaspoon salt and the pepper. Coat chicken parts with flour mixture.</p>
<p>Cook bacon in 12-inch skillet over medium heat until crisp. Remove bacon with 
slotted spoon and then lay on paper towel, patting them down with another sheet. 
Set the bacon aside and cook the chicken in the bacon fat over medium heat 
flipping the pieces over with a spatula every couple of minutes, until the 
chicken is browned on all sides, then give it a minute or two more. 
(Approximately at least 15 minutes)</p>
<p>Move chicken to one side of the skillet and add the onions and mushrooms to 
the other side.&nbsp; Cook over medium-high heat, stirring generously, until the 
mushrooms are tender. Tilt the skillet over the sink to drain the fat.</p>
<p>Crumble the bacon and stir it with the rest of the ingredients into the 
vegetables, making sure the bouquet garni is as deep in the sauce as possible. 
Heat to boiling then reduce heat to low. Cover the pan and simmer for about 35 
minutes or until the juice of the chicken is no longer pink when the centers of 
the thickest pieces are cut. Remove bouquet garni.&nbsp; Skim off excess fat.</p>
