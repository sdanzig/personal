<p>Lemon-Coconut Bars</p>
<ul>
  <li>1 c all-purpose flour</li>
  <li>
<font face="Times New Roman">½ c softened butter.&nbsp; Just leave a stick of 
butter out until it's soft and can be easily smeared.</font></li>
  <li>
<font face="Times New Roman">¼ c powdered sugar (confectioner's sugar).&nbsp; 
Keep the rest of the bag handy too, for decoration.</font></li>
  <li>
<font face="Times New Roman">1 c granulated sugar</font></li>
  <li>
<font face="Times New Roman">2 tsp freshly grated lemon peel. Don't grate the 
white stuff, just scrape off the yellow part.</font></li>
  <li>
<font face="Times New Roman">2 tbsp lemon juice.&nbsp; You can squeeze the same 
lemon for this.</font></li>
  <li>
<font face="Times New Roman">½ c flaked coconut.&nbsp; You could get away with 
using the sweetened coconut flakes you get in the store, but I find cracking 
open and coarsely grating a fresh coconut is fun and gives a better result. Most 
won't notice the difference though.</font></li>
  <li>
<font face="Times New Roman">½ tsp baking powder</font></li>
  <li>
<font face="Times New Roman">¼ tsp salt</font></li>
  <li>
<font face="Times New Roman">2 large eggs</font></li>
</ul>
<p>Heat oven to 350 F</p>
<p>Mix flour, butter, and <font face="Times New Roman">¼ cup powdered sugar. 
Press in ungreased square pan, around 8 x 8 x 2 inches, building up ½-inch 
edges.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">Bake crust 15 minutes; remove from oven once 
parts of the crust look a bit gold/brown. If you're not sure, just take it out. 
Undercooking can be remedied.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">While baking, beat remaining ingredients except 
the powdered sugar with an electric mixer on high speed for about 4 minutes. 
Pour over the hot crust when it's ready.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">Bake around 25 minutes longer. It's done when 
you can tap your finger very lightly on the center and there's no indentation. 
If the edges start to get anywhere near dark brown though, you've probably 
misjudged and it's ready immediately. Cool in the pan placed on a wire rack or 
something close to one. Sprinkle very stingily with powdered sugar from about a 
foot over the pan and cut into 5 rows, 5 columns and serve ASAP (hot is better, 
although it's still delicious cooled off too).</font></p>
