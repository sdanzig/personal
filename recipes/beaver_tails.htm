<p>Beaver Tails</p>

<p>
<font face="Times New Roman">Dough ingredients:</font></p>
<ul>
  <li>
<font face="Times New Roman">½</font> c warm water (Warm means 80-90 F. Over 100 
  F might kill the yeast)</li>
  <li>5 ts yeast</li>
  <li>pinch of white sugar</li>
  <li>1 c warm milk</li>
  <li><font face="Times New Roman">&#8531;</font> c sugar</li>
  <li>1<font face="Times New Roman">½</font> ts salt</li>
  <li>1 teaspoon vanilla</li>
  <li>2 beaten eggs</li>
  <li><font face="Times New Roman">&#8531;</font> c canola oil</li>
  <li>5 c all-purpose flour</li>
</ul>

<p>Cinnamon-sugar coating ingredients:</p>
<ul>
  <li>2 c sugar</li>
  <li>3 ts cinnamon</li>
</ul>

<p>Mix the warm water, yeast, and pinch of sugar in a large bowl. Let rise for 5 
minutes.</p>

<p>Add all remaining dough ingredients except the flour and stir until smooth. 
Mix in the flour, then knead for 8 minutes.</p>

<p>Place in a lightly greased bowl, cover with a damp (moistened, not dripping 
wet) cloth towel, and let rise for 35 minutes.</p>

<p>Put the 2 cups sugar and the cinnamon in a closed container and shake 
vigorously to mix.</p>

<p>Gently punch down the inflated dough then pinch off small balls of dough and 
roll into ovals. Place balls aside, covered with cloth towel and let rest while 
you finish the rest of the balls. Heat 4 inches of oil in a frying pan, to 375 
degrees. Just before cooking, stretch ball into a beaver tail shape, flattening 
or enlarging as needed. Fry in oil, turning only once, until deep brown. Drain 
off oil then quickly toss in cinnamon sugar while still hot.<br>
<br>
Notes:<br>
Best served warm and can be reheated in a microwave.<br>
This dough can be made in a bread machine on the dough setting by placing all 
dough ingredients except flour and yeast in pan, completely covering with flour, 
then sprinkling yeast on top. Once the dough cycle is complete, place the 
mixture to rise as described above.</p>
