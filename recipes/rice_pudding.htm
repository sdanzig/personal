<p>Rice Pudding</p>
<ul>
  <li><font face="Times New Roman">¾</font> c raw long-grain rice</li>
  <li>
<font face="Times New Roman">¼</font> tsp vanilla</li>
  <li>2 large eggs, slightly beaten</li>
  <li>
<font face="Times New Roman">&#8539;</font> tsp salt</li>
  <li>1<font face="Times New Roman">½</font> c milk</li>
  <li>
<font face="Times New Roman">½ c g</font>olden raisins</li>
  <li>1<font face="Times New Roman">½</font> c heavy cream</li>
  <li>
<font face="Times New Roman">½</font> tsp ground cinnamon</li>
  <li>
<font face="Times New Roman">&#8531;</font> c granulated sugar</li>
  <li>2 tsp grated lemon peel. Only scrape off the yellow part of the peel, and don't 
let freshly grated peels sit too long.</li>
  <li>2 tsp grated orange peel. Only scrape off the orange, not the white.</li>
  <li>whipped cream</li>
</ul>
<p>Prepare the rice in 1<font face="Times New Roman">½</font> cups of water 
according to package directions. The idea is, the rice supposed to be fully 
cooked when all the water evaporates, and you're supposed to keep it completely 
covered until then, keeping the heat as low as possible.&nbsp; I find you can 
check a grain or two of rice every so often after 10 minutes of cooking, and 
feel free to add more water if it looks like the water is evaporating too 
quickly (to avoid burning the rice) or you can pull it off quicker if you're 
sure the rice is good enough, then just drain off the rest of the water.</p>
<p>While 
the rice is cooking, preheat the oven to 350 F. Grease an 8 inch square baking 
dish.</p>
<p>In a large bowl combine the eggs, milk, cream, sugar, grated peels, 
vanilla, and salt, beating until well-blended. Stir the raisins into the rice 
and spoon the rice mixture into the prepared baking dish. Pour the egg mixture 
over the rice and sprinkle with the cinnamon. Place the baking dish in the oven 
in a larger baking pan filled with enough hot water to come halfway up the sides 
of the baking dish. Bake for 45 minutes until pudding is almost set (top layer 
is firm, except right at the center), stirring once after 10 minutes and again 
15 minutes later. The last stirring should ensure the spreading of ingredients, 
especially the raisins, into the top half of the dish.</p>
<p>Remove the baking dish 
from the larger pan and cool on a wire rack, cooling until cold. Refrigerate, 
covered for at least 5 hours. Serve with whipped cream. Don't try to eat too 
much at once.</p>
