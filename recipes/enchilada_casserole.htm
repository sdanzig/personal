<p>Enchilada Casserole</p>
<ul>
  <li>
<font face="Times New Roman">1½ lb lean ground beef</font></li>
  <li>
<font face="Times New Roman">1 medium onion, chopped</font></li>
  <li>
<font face="Times New Roman">1 (8 oz) can tomato sauce</font></li>
  <li>1 (12 oz) can Mexicorn, drained (usually corn mixed with green and red 
  peppers and maybe other things)</li>
  <li>1 (2<font face="Times New Roman">¼ oz) can sliced ripe olives, drained</font></li>
  <li><font face="Times New Roman">1 (10 oz) can hot enchilada sauce. Careful 
  not to accidentally buy mild. That would ruin the dish in my eyes.</font></li>
  <li>
<font face="Times New Roman">½ tsp salt</font></li>
  <li>
<font face="Times New Roman">½ tsp oregano</font></li>
  <li><font face="Times New Roman">¼ tsp chili powder</font></li>
  <li><font face="Times New Roman">¼ tsp pepper</font></li>
  <li><font face="Times New Roman">12 small corn tortillas. They have a diameter 
  of about 6 inches. If you can't find corn tortillas, flour tortillas work too.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Times New Roman">2 cups shredded cheese, preferably a mix of 
  cheddar and Monterey, but definitely at least cheddar.</font></li>
</ul>
<p>In 2-quart casserole, combine ground beef and onion. Cover. Microwave at high 
for 6 to 10 minutes until meat is thoroughly cooked; stir after 5 minutes. You 
can assume that all microwave cooking is done uncovered, except the reheating at 
the end.&nbsp; Drain meat thoroughly, squeezing the juice out of the beef and 
patting it down afterwards with paper towel. Add tomato sauce, corn, ripe 
olives, enchilada sauce, salt, oregano, chili powder and pepper. Microwave at 
high for 3 to 5 minutes.</p>
<p>Place six of the tortillas around the bottom of a 2-quart oblong baking dish. 
(13x9 in.) Try not to overlap the tortillas much, just overlapping the edges, 
spreading them in an oval, fully covering the bottom of the baking dish and part 
of the sides as well. Pour half of the meat mixture over the tortillas. Sprinkle 
1 cup of the cheese on top. Repeat the layers, starting with another layer of 
tortillas laid out the same way, then the rest of the meat mixture, then the 
cheese. Microwave at high for 10 minutes, or until the cheese is fully melted, 
or a few more minutes if you want to serve the dish right away. For a stiffer 
casserole (improves the presentation a bit and makes serving easier), 
refrigerate overnight and to serve, microwave, covered with vent holes, to 
preferred heat.</p>
