<p>Bazin-quiche<br>
<br>
Crust:</p>
<ul>
  <li>2 c flour</li>
  <li>dash of salt</li>
  <li>1 c (2 sticks) butter</li>
  <li>1 tbsp oil</li>
  <li>At least 2 tbsp cold water</li>
</ul>
<p>Filling:</p>
<ul>
  <li>4 eggs</li>
  <li>
<font face="Times New Roman">½ tsp salt</font></li>
  <li>
<font face="Times New Roman">¾ lb ground beef</font></li>
  <li>4 strips of bacon</li>
  <li>6 diced medium-sized mushrooms</li>
  <li>
<font face="Times New Roman">½ medium onion, chopped up</font></li>
  <li>1<font face="Times New Roman">½ c grated sharp cheddar cheese</font></li>
  <li>1<font face="Times New Roman">½ c milk</font></li>
  <li>2 tbsp flour</li>
  <li>paprika</li>
</ul>
<p>Preheat oven to 350 F.</p>
<p>To make the crust:<br>
Mix flour and salt in bowl. Cut in 1 cup butter and oil until mixture resembles 
coarse meal (tiny pieces, but much coarser than sand). Sprinkle with water, 
tossing with fork until dough holds together, sprinkling a bit more water if 
necessary. Gather into ball and chill a few minutes if&nbsp;&nbsp; dough is too 
soft to handle. Roll out pastry on floured board and fit into 10 inch 
spring-form pan, forming <font face="Times New Roman">a ¾ inch edge.&nbsp; Leave 
in oven for about 3-4 minutes to dry out the remove and set aside.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">To make filling:</font><br>
Cook ground beef in a frying pan on medium heat, chopping and stirring until 
brown. Let drain on paper towels while patting down VERY thoroughly. Press down 
on the beef to extract juice from it. You want it to be as dry as possible. Set 
aside.</p>
<p>Pour off fat from beef and cook bacon in the pan next, on high heat, frying 
until crispy. Move to paper towels and pat down just as thoroughly, then crumple 
the strips. Set aside.</p>
<p>Cook the mushrooms and onion in the pan over medium heat, frying until 
tender. Move the mushroom and onion onto a paper towel to drain and once again 
pat down to dry thoroughly, squeezing some of the juice out.</p>
<p>Mix eggs, milk, and flour in a bowl and beat well till fully blended.</p>
<p>Spread cheese evenly in bottom of crust.</p>
<p>Mix in a separate bowl the beef, mushrooms and onion, crumbling the bacon 
strips and mixing those in as well, then spread the mixture evenly over the 
cheese.</p>
<p>Slowly pour in the egg mixture.</p>
<p>Pour in egg mixture.</p>
<p>Bake at 375 degrees 35 - 45 minutes, until solid in center, then either serve 
hot or cold, good either way.</p>
<p>As a side note, this recipe can be modified tremendously, although this is my 
personal favorite. Another good variation is using just a pound of mushrooms and 
swiss cheese. Diced peppers can be used too.</p>
