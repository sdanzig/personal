<p>Tiramisu</p>

<ul>
  <li>24 ladyfingers, little cookies generally available near the coffee or the 
crackers in the grocery store. Prepare by toasting 15 minutes in the oven at 300 
F</li>
  <li>2 c espresso coffee, cooled.&nbsp; You can substitute this with 2 cups very 
strong instant coffee, using twice the normal strength.</li>
  <li>6 eggs, separated into separate cups</li>
  <li>6 tbsp sugar</li>
  <li>1 lb mascarpone</li>
  <li>2 tbsp marsala wine</li>
  <li>2 tbsp triple sec</li>
  <li>2 tbsp brandy</li>
  <li>2 tbsp orange extract</li>
  <li>8 oz bittersweet chocolate, finely chopped</li>
</ul>

<p>Arrange the ladyfingers on a plate and lightly soak them with the cooled 
espresso.&nbsp; Put half of the soaked ladyfingers in one layer in a rectangular 
serving dish.&nbsp; While the ladyfingers are soaking, beat the egg yolks with 
the sugar until the yolks turn pale in color. Add the mascarpone, the liquors, 
and the extract, and stir gently. In a separate bowl, beat the egg whites with a 
wire whisk until they are	stiff. By stiff, it means that the entire batch of 
egg whites, not just the top layer, has taken on a foamy, shapeable texture. 
Gently fold the whites into the mascarpone mixture. Use half of this mixture to 
make a layer on top of the ladyfingers in the serving dish.&nbsp; Sprinkle with 
half of the chopped chocolate. Repeat the procedure with another layer of soaked 
ladyfingers, the mascarpone mixture, and chocolate.&nbsp; Cover with tin foil 
and refrigerate for at least 2 hours before serving. </p>
