<body><h1>Sachsenhausen Concentration Camp</h1><br><br><img src="images/berlin/sachsenhausen/berlin-027.JPG" alt=""><br>We
wanted to take one of the free walking tours of Berlin, to see
everything it had to offer during our brief time there, so we planned
carefully. &nbsp;We got tickets in advance and sprung out from a nearby
Starbucks into line. &nbsp;We were confused when the first thing we did
was get on a subway and head out to a concentration camp. &nbsp;I
figured it was something interesting to see, and a nice part of our
sightseeing. &nbsp;This is a memorial for the death marches prisoners
were forced to endure near the end of the second world war.<br><br><br><img src="images/berlin/sachsenhausen/berlin-028.JPG" alt=""><br>Here's our Scottish tour guide (note the tartan). &nbsp;It was cold, so it was good for her she was dressed warm.<br><br><br><img src="images/berlin/sachsenhausen/berlin-029.JPG" alt=""><br>Clearly marked walls on the way in the camp.<br><br><br><img src="images/berlin/sachsenhausen/berlin-031.JPG" alt=""><br>One of the guard towers on the way in.<br><br><br><img src="images/berlin/sachsenhausen/berlin-032.JPG" alt=""><br>Our tour group circles a model showing the layout of the camp. <br><br><br><img src="images/berlin/sachsenhausen/berlin-033.JPG" alt=""><br>We realized there was a lot of walking on this tour and wondered how much time we'd have for the rest of Berlin.<br><br><br><img src="images/berlin/sachsenhausen/berlin-034.JPG" alt=""><br>We plodded forth toward the gates leading into the camp.<br><br><br><img src="images/berlin/sachsenhausen/berlin-036.JPG" alt=""><br>Arbeit macht frei, "Work will set you free". &nbsp;Hopefully it helped some inmates hang on long enough to survive.<br><br><br><img src="images/berlin/sachsenhausen/berlin-038.JPG" alt=""><br>Behind
the gates is a massive watchtower. &nbsp;Towers were strategically
positioned to minimize the number of guards needed to oversee the camp.<br><br><br><img src="images/berlin/sachsenhausen/berlin-039.JPG" alt=""><br>Triangles,
formerly worn by resident inmates, decorate the Soviet Liberation
Memorial tower. &nbsp;In front is a controversial statue showing a
heroic scene of prisoners being rescued. &nbsp;Many say that it does
not accurately represent what prisoners really looked like when they
were rescued.<br><br><br><img src="images/berlin/sachsenhausen/berlin-042.JPG" alt=""><br>This was sculpted to provide a truer sense of what the liberators actually saw.<br><br><br><img src="images/berlin/sachsenhausen/berlin-040.JPG" alt=""><br>Preserved washing facilities.<br><br><br><img src="images/berlin/sachsenhausen/berlin-041.JPG" alt=""><br>Within
the prison these odd cartoons were drawn by&nbsp;Hans Fischerkoesen,
who was in an underground resistance of artists but was imprisoned by
Russians in Sachsenhausen under suspicion of collaboration with the
Nazis. <br><br><br><img src="images/berlin/sachsenhausen/berlin-045.JPG" alt=""><br>There
was an intricate layout of rooms for processing, with visibility such
that prisoners were unaware of their impending death.<br><br><br><img src="images/berlin/sachsenhausen/berlin-046.JPG" alt=""><br>Here
are the ovens used to actually burn the corpses. &nbsp;This was the
conclusion of our walking tour. &nbsp;Yes, we got in the wrong line.
&nbsp;I can see going back to Berlin one day, but I think I've had my
fill of concentration camps.<br><br><br><br><a href="berlin.html">Back</a></body></html>
