I did not take long to find a couchsurfing host to stay with. &nbsp;I
stayed with an interesting dude named Bjorn who was very much into
music and politics. &nbsp;Admittedly, he was a bit busy, so I didn't
get to chitchat much, but he was waiting for me at the bus station and
led me to his home pictured here. &nbsp;It didn't look like much from
the streetside, but from the backyard, doesn't this look like a fun
place?<br>
<br>
<br>
<img src="images/iceland/reykjavik/iceland%20656.jpg" alt=""><img src="images/iceland/reykjavik/iceland%20659.jpg" alt=""><img src="images/iceland/reykjavik/iceland%20661.jpg" alt=""><br>I
did some bird-peeping in the backyard. &nbsp;I was there in March,
slightly out of season for puffins, so I had to make the most of it.
&nbsp;These birds are cute too.<br><br><br><img src="images/iceland/reykjavik/iceland%20053.jpg" alt=""><br>
Out of the 20 or so couchsurfers who expressed interest in joining me,
only a handful showed up, like this dude who I knew from Boston.<br>
<br>
<br>
<img src="images/iceland/reykjavik/iceland%20054.jpg" alt=""><br>
And out of that handful, only Luis here joined me on my travels.
&nbsp;Luis (also known as Eduardo, or the Big E) is a really good
friend to have. &nbsp;I wanted to really see what Iceland had to offer,
and try to see the Northern Lights. &nbsp;He was all up for it.<br>
<br>
<br>
<img src="images/iceland/reykjavik/iceland%20060.jpg" alt=""><br>
&nbsp;We were not alone though. &nbsp;Here's the band of couchsurfers
and hosts that were kind enough to join us at a quiet place called the
"Næsti bar". &nbsp;Næsti means "next" in Icelandic. &nbsp;It's a
wonderful concept for a bar. &nbsp;You first go to a loud, wild bar
somewhere in Reykjavík, then you go to a quieter place, or the "next
bar". &nbsp;It was a perfect place for us to get to know each other.
&nbsp;Braggi, a local, is on the far right, fielding some questions.
&nbsp;The girl with red hair in the lower left is Elfa. &nbsp;You'll
see other pics of Elfa later, but I'll jump at the chance to say she
was a dream come true as far as guides in Iceland go.<br><br><br><img src="images/iceland/reykjavik/iceland%20055.jpg" alt=""><br>
Aside from Björk, who I admittedly used to call "Buh-jork" with J as in
Joe, Iceland is known for its music from other musicians. &nbsp;In a
music store, two examples of these are being sold on the top shelf.
&nbsp;To the left is the latest album of Sigur Rós, an
ethereal-sounding rock band, and to the right is Emilíana Torrini, who
apparently sung "Gollum's Song" at the end of the second Lord of the
Rings movie. &nbsp;It's from Wikipedia, but that's too obscure to be
false.<br>
<br>
<br><img src="images/iceland/borgarnes/iceland%20625.jpg" alt=""><br>We came to this area for whale-watching, or at least whale-eating. &nbsp;Whale-watching was out of season.<br><br><br>
<img src="images/iceland/reykjavik/iceland%20626.jpg" alt=""><br>Thankfully whale eating was very much in-season. &nbsp;This, my friends, is Minke whale. &nbsp;As much as I prefer whales not
be eaten, Icelanders supposedly only much down about seven per year,
and the meat is SO good. &nbsp;Picture the most tender, succulent steak
you've ever eaten. &nbsp;Mmmmmm. &nbsp;I'm okay with giving them two or
three more.<br>
<br>
<br>
<img src="images/iceland/reykjavik/iceland%20635.jpg" alt=""><br>I saw
this and grabbed it. &nbsp;There's a stage in beer making where you
have sweet, unfermented wort, and you can sample some before adding the
yeast. &nbsp;It tastes very good and it gives a good idea of what the
resulting beer will be like, but it's too sweet to drink a lot of it.
&nbsp;Well, this carbonated beverage reminded me of that wonderful
sweet beery taste. &nbsp;It was not too sweet and frosty and
refreshing. &nbsp;Non-alcoholic, but I had to try it anyway.<br><br>
<br>
<img src="images/iceland/reykjavik/iceland%20638.jpg" alt=""><br>
After whale, we went for old-fashioned ice cream. &nbsp;It's
old-fashioned because it's made with milk rather than cream. &nbsp;The
ice cream was nice because it was different, but certainly is lacking
in the smoothness of a creamier dessert. &nbsp;Here I'm spying on the
old-fashioned ice cream lady by leaning over her counter.<br>
<br>
<br>
<img src="images/iceland/reykjavik/iceland%20639.jpg" alt=""><br>
It was odd how she stacks the ice cream up tall and thin like this.
&nbsp;Perhaps old-fashioned ice cream makes a better construction
material. &nbsp;To the left of the ice cream, you can see some
Icelandic krónur. &nbsp;By the way, I'm pretty good at figuring out how
to type out the authentic Icelandic letters complete with their
accents, but if you're trying to figure out how anything Icelandic is
pronounced, just stop. &nbsp;It's a life-battle not worth fighting.<br>
<br>
<br>
<img src="images/iceland/reykjavik/iceland%20640.jpg" alt=""><br>
Here's proof that old-fashioned ice cream is good for construction.
&nbsp;This was how mine was served. &nbsp;While the cup was a little
heavy on one side, this isn't melting and about to fall over.
&nbsp;This is how it was served to me, and it gave me the impression it
would stay at this forty degree tilt for at least another hour before
something flopped over.<br>
<br>
<br>
<img src="images/iceland/reykjavik/iceland%20641.jpg" alt=""><br>
Here's actual Icelandic beer with a cute name. &nbsp;The brewery is
based in Reykjavík. &nbsp;To the right is a glimpse of Jökull Bjór, a
local beer from Stykkishólmur, another one of our destinations. &nbsp;I
only tried the latter. &nbsp;It had a good flavor, but I'd much sooner
choose a Belgian or German variety.<br>
<br>
<br>
<img src="images/iceland/reykjavik/iceland%20644.jpg" alt=""><br>I
heard of this famous hot dog stand on the internet. &nbsp;Supposedly
this gets visited by famous people, including former President Bill
Clinton. &nbsp;You go up, ask for the works, and eat what you get.
&nbsp;It's pretty cheap too.<br><br><br><img src="images/iceland/reykjavik/iceland%20643.jpg" alt=""><br>
Here's the picture of Bill Clinton patronizing the establishment that
they have posted on a billboard. &nbsp;Below that is my partially eaten
hot dog. &nbsp;They put two sauces on the hot dog, one orange and the
other a pale yellow. &nbsp;I believe one of them is called <span class="Apple-style-span" style="border-collapse: separate; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: arial,sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal; orphans: 2; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; font-size: small;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="border-collapse: collapse; font-size: 17px; white-space: pre;">remoulade, which is a common condiment Icelanders use for hot dogs.</span></span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="border-collapse: separate; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: arial,sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal; orphans: 2; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; font-size: small;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="border-collapse: collapse; font-size: 17px; white-space: pre;"></span></span><br>

I peeked in a closed art store and saw this landscape painting with dramatic colors.<br>
<br>
<br>
<img src="images/iceland/reykjavik/iceland%20654.jpg" alt=""><br>
Here are less dramatic paintings in the same gallery.<br>
<br>
<br>

was pointed to this building housing a flea market. &nbsp;I was told
they open early in the morning and I could try cured shark meat here.<br><br><br><img src="images/iceland/reykjavik/iceland%20665.jpg" alt=""><br>
One thing I definitely grabbed a bag of was the dried fish. &nbsp;They
have different fish, but most is haddock. &nbsp;It's the seaman's beef
jerky. &nbsp;Very fun to gnaw on and quite tasty.<br>
<br>
<br>
<img src="images/iceland/reykjavik/iceland%20668.jpg" alt=""><br>
Also at the flea market was plenty of clothing. &nbsp;At the bottom you
can see authentically-patterned Icelandic wool sweaters. &nbsp;I don't
particularly like the pattern, but I saw the type of weather sheep out
there live in and was very convinced that you can make very warm
sweaters from them.<br>
<br>
<br>
<img src="images/iceland/reykjavik/iceland%20669.jpg" alt=""><br>
All sorts of creepy walking sticks.<br>
<br>
<br>
<img src="images/iceland/reykjavik/iceland%20670.jpg" alt=""><br>
Here it is... cured shark meat. &nbsp;THIS, out of all things, was one
of the "must tries" during my visit to Iceland. &nbsp;There are certain
flavors that I find to be the most disgusting flavors on earth, and
urine is one of them. &nbsp;That's exactly what this tastes like.
&nbsp;I also have trouble with roquefort cheese, vegemite, dutch
licorice, and unsweetened chocolate, but this was worse than all of
those. &nbsp;I was a trooper though, because this was effectively my
lunch for the day, and proceeded to eat half of this before I gave up.<br>
<br>
<br>
<img src="images/iceland/reykjavik/iceland%20672.jpg" alt=""><br>
Memories from Iceland... mountain air. &nbsp;I never knew they sold $15 dumb tourist taxes in cans.<br>
<br>
<br>

A tall ship parked at Reykjavík.<br>
<br>
<br>
<img src="images/iceland/reykjavik/iceland%20680.jpg" alt=""><br>
I wandered on to Reykjavík's city hall. &nbsp;It was in an interesting
spot, with a entrance leading to a footbridge over a lake.<br>
<br>
<br>
<img src="images/iceland/reykjavik/iceland%20681.jpg" alt=""><br>
In this lake there's a swarm of birds. &nbsp;The lake, like all of
Iceland's hot water, is heated geothermally. &nbsp;This attracts
shivering birds. &nbsp;As a result, there's a lot of crap on the
sidewalk too, but I think it's worth it.<br>
<br>
<br>
<img src="images/iceland/reykjavik/iceland%20682.jpg" alt=""><br>
This effectively is like a bird hot tub. &nbsp;Not that warm to us, but fine if you have feathers.<br>
<br>
<br>
<img src="images/iceland/reykjavik/iceland%20688.jpg" alt=""><br>
Plaques describing each type of visiting birds are mounted in front of
the lake. &nbsp;I found I could spend quite some time just watching and
learning about these birds.<br>
<br>

A boy and his father were feeding breadcrumbs to these avians.<br>
<br>
<br>
<img src="images/iceland/reykjavik/iceland%20694.jpg" alt=""><br>
Eventually they ran out of breadcrumbs, so the swans scared them off.<br>
<br>
<br>
<img src="images/iceland/reykjavik/iceland%20699.jpg" alt=""><br>
Here's a bumpy map in city hall showing the layout of Iceland. &nbsp;Reykjavík is to the southwest.<br>
<br>
<br>
<img src="images/iceland/reykjavik/iceland%20707.jpg" alt=""><br>
The lake got colder the farther you got from city hall. &nbsp;Past the lake you can see Reykjavík with the beautiful <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hallgr%C3%ADmskirkja">Hallgrímskirkja church</a>, at the time under construction, visible on the horizon.<br>

As I headed north from the lake, I saw this building in the distance,
thinking it maybe was the national museum I was looking for.<br>
<br>
<br>
<img src="images/iceland/reykjavik/iceland%20722.jpg" alt=""><br>
It turns out the national museum looked completely different.<br>

Some of the original settlers of Iceland had worse fates.<br>
<br>
<br>
<img src="images/iceland/reykjavik/iceland%20736.jpg" alt=""><br>
They had nifty pull-out ancient documents. &nbsp;When you were done
reading, you slide the ancient document back in the wall. &nbsp;I'd
imagine this is better than constant light exposure.<br>
<br>
<br>
<img src="images/iceland/reykjavik/iceland%20737.jpg" alt=""><br>
There was an exhibition on child labor. &nbsp;Icelanders value work and
teach children at an early age how to be useful. &nbsp;I really have no
problem with children working, since I am no longer a child.<br>
<br>
<br>

One of the early maps of Iceland drawn by sailors. &nbsp;It has the contours roughly right.<br>
<br>

<img src="images/iceland/reykjavik/iceland%20744.jpg" alt=""><br>
This looked gold and expensive so I took a picture of it.<br>
<br>
<br>

It's hard to imagine someone taking this coat of arms seriously. &nbsp;Cute bear with big furry paws.<br>
<br>
<br>
<img src="images/iceland/reykjavik/iceland%20746.jpg" alt=""><br>
The museum had a conveyer belt displaying artifacts of modern Icelandic
culture. &nbsp;I used to have an Atari 7800 with Donkey Kong.
&nbsp;Iceland had fully embraced a consumerist economy.<br>
<br>
<br>
<img src="images/iceland/reykjavik/iceland%20747.jpg" alt=""><br>
Maybe this marketing works for Icelanders, but I really think they
should have consulted a chef. &nbsp;From the picture, I'd think there
was a top-quality doorstop in that box.<br>

Adjusted the camera settings, took a picture, and brightened accordingly later in Photoshop, all so you can see clearly inside.<br>
<br>
<br>
<img src="images/iceland/reykjavik/iceland%20753.jpg" alt=""><br>
As I rounded the National museum, I didn't realize I was stepping in
more than a puddle. &nbsp;This is a deep pool of icy water with no
barrier, so if you're not watching where you walk, you can end up with
a cold, wet shoe like I did, which is not good when it's freezing out.<br>
<br>
<br>
<img src="images/iceland/reykjavik/iceland%20756.jpg" alt=""><br>
Here's another couchsurfer, Cherie, who came to Iceland but decided
against joining Luis and I. &nbsp;I knew approximately where she was,
and remembered she was talking about a pizza place she liked nearby.
&nbsp;I decided to swing by the pizza place thinking I might find her.
&nbsp;There she was, holding a pizza, about to go back to her
apartment. &nbsp;This is how couchsurfers find each other half the
time. &nbsp;You have to think logically about where someone will be and
more often than not, you're right. &nbsp;Cherie was considering moving
out to Iceland, and this apartment is her trial run. &nbsp;The phrase
on her shirt means "I don't speak Icelandic." &nbsp;Almost everyone in
Iceland speaks English, and they're not shy of using it either, so this
shirt is not really a necessity. &nbsp;However, for those very
frustrated with the difficulty of the language, I can see a shirt like
this making a very pointed statement.<br>
<br>
<br>
<img src="images/iceland/reykjavik/iceland%20760.jpg" alt=""><br>
Here's Cherie's cat. &nbsp;I could never bring myself to kill such a
cute animal, but it was cold enough outside for me to&nbsp;name this
kitty "Scarf".<br>
<br>
<br>
<img src="images/iceland/reykjavik/iceland%20762.jpg" alt=""><br>
Here's the oddly shaped "Pearl", made from converted hot water storage
tanks. &nbsp;One of the tanks was cleared for the "Saga Museum", which
is all about vikings.<br>

I liked the advertising here. &nbsp;In Iceland, they like to eat
sheep's heads. &nbsp;Just seems weird, and this ad doesn't help either.<br>

As the sky darkens, statues of warriors become more dramatic.<br>

showed us around parts of Reykjavik too, along with the remaining
west coast of Iceland. &nbsp;She agreed it'd be good to meet up for
food one
more time before we left. &nbsp;If I'm not mistaken, I think she knows
how to use chopsticks the right way. &nbsp;I certainly don't.<br><br><br><img src="images/iceland/reykjavik/iceland%201000.jpg" alt=""><br>
Here's the Asian cuisine she ate as we had our last moments together.<br>

This was posted outside a clothing store in Reykjavik. &nbsp;I saw this
on my way back to my host's place. &nbsp;When I got back, I met a
good-natured couple that happened to be my host's new guests. &nbsp;It
was already late and I had to leave at some crazy time like 4am, so I
let them take the couch rather than sleeping on the floor. &nbsp;I left
at 4am and made a wrong turn on the way to the bus station. &nbsp;It
was absolutely frigid, and everything was closed, so this was
potentially dangerous to my toes. &nbsp;Fortunately I found my way to
the bus station. &nbsp;That apparently was closed too, but a nice guy
inside saw me crying near the window and let me in 15 minutes early.<br><br><br>
