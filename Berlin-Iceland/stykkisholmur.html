Elfa drove Luis and I up to Stykkishólmur, which is about two hours
north of Reykjavík. &nbsp;The plan was to head up there, stay at the
summer home of one of Elfa's friends, and then visit an island the next
day. &nbsp;On the way, we got a small sampling of Iceland's majesty.<br>
<br>
<br>

Weather is supposedly very unpredictable in Iceland, but in terms of precipitation, we were golden.<br>
<br>
<br>

Rippled mountains stretched across the earth like a slumbering zebra.<br>
<br>
<br>
<img src="images/iceland/stykkisholmur/iceland%20074.jpg" alt=""><br>
I think the horizontal stripes makes this mountain look fatter.<br>

Here's a shot of the summer home we stayed in for two nights. &nbsp;We
had our own rooms with cozy beds. &nbsp;If you couchsurf outside of the
major cities, you very well can end up in something spacious and
comfortable.<br>
<br>
<br>

Stykkishólmur is a colorful, scenic, rimy little town on the sea.
&nbsp;Quite peaceful. &nbsp;The houses in Iceland seem simpler and even
minimalist compared to what I'm used to in the US.<br>
<br>

A cheap way for young 'uns (un is a good Scrabble word) to get around
is at youth hostels. &nbsp;You'll find them everywhere, including this
obscure city.<br>
<br>
<br>

Here's the first good picture of our darling Elfa, holding a frozen
sheep's head at a "Bónus"&nbsp;grocery store. &nbsp;Yes, you can see
the eye in this picture.<br>
<br>

Dining room in the summer home. &nbsp;Here is where we planned out the rest of our trip.<br>
<br>
<br>

Atop a hill there was a queer-looking museum. &nbsp;It was even queerer
as I actually visited it, but you'll see what I mean in later pictures.
&nbsp;According to Elfa, it's a water museum. &nbsp;What exactly that
meant I had no idea.<br>
<br>
<br>
<img src="images/iceland/stykkisholmur/iceland%20096.jpg" alt=""><br>
More simple buildings.<br>
<br>

Boats docked at Stykkishólmur. &nbsp;Mountains in easy view in the distance.<br>
<br>
<br>
<img src="images/iceland/stykkisholmur/iceland%20099.jpg" alt=""><br>
This is a very iconic picture of Stykkishólmur. &nbsp;The boat
sculpture represents the rugged sea-farers. &nbsp;Also, there's a very
recognizable rock in the background that is in half the Stykkishólmur
postcards.<br>
<br>

Stitched together some pictures off Stykkishólmur's coast. &nbsp;That's Elfa to the left.<br>

You can see this bird's bright orange feet. &nbsp;Too cute.<br>
<br>

Elfa stares toward Polaris, in a state of serenity.<br>

Some of the cargo that gets loaded onto the boats in the marina.<br>
<br>
<br>
<img src="images/iceland/stykkisholmur/iceland%20155.jpg" alt=""><br>We visited the water museum at the top of the hill. &nbsp;Very unique idea
thought up by an American artist who now lives out here. &nbsp;Each of the
columns here are filled with water from a different glacier in Iceland.
&nbsp;Each column of water had its own character, some a little cloudier
than others. &nbsp;When the arctic melts, the glaciers of Iceland will be
preserved.<br><br><br><img src="images/iceland/stykkisholmur/iceland%20145.jpg" alt=""><br>
Words on the ground in both English and Icelandic describe Iceland's weather.<br>
<br>
<br>
<img src="images/iceland/stykkisholmur/iceland%20146.jpg" alt=""><br>
This word means "merciless".<br>
<br>
<br>

Here's an overview of Stykkishólmur. &nbsp;
This church on the right is not just a work of art that looks a little like a Sphinx...<br><br><br><img src="images/iceland/stykkisholmur/iceland%20090.jpg" alt=""><br>It's also a feat of aerospace engineering.<br>
<br>
<br>
<img src="images/iceland/stykkisholmur/iceland%20149%20Stitch.jpg" alt=""><br>
Here's a stitched together panoramic from inside the museum.
&nbsp;That's why there are two Elfas. &nbsp;That shadowy face on the
right is the artist responsible for this place.<br>
<br>

We stopped in an Icelandic bakery. &nbsp;I asked Elfa what was
traditional Icelandic and she pointed me to these. &nbsp;They were
good. &nbsp;Not dry, not too sweet, not too sticky. &nbsp;Just a good
snack to hold us over till we could cook something, because all the
restaurants were closed in Stykkishólmur in late March.<br>
<br>
<br>
<img src="images/iceland/stykkisholmur/iceland%20158.jpg" alt=""><br>
We stopped back at the water museum at night and peeked in for a
picture. &nbsp;The columns looked ethereal. &nbsp;I'd say the visit was
worth it.<br>
<br>
<br>
<img src="images/iceland/stykkisholmur/iceland%20162.jpg" alt=""><br>
Here's a view of the pier at night.<br>
<br>
<br>
<img src="images/iceland/stykkisholmur/iceland%20172.jpg" alt=""><br>
From this viewing platform, there was one of those charts that show
what direction and how far, in kilometers, various locations around
Iceland are.<br>
<br>
<br>
<img src="images/iceland/stykkisholmur/iceland%20174.jpg" alt=""><br>
We did manage to sneak into a little cafe for a cup of coffee.
&nbsp;However, given the opportunity, I'll often opt for a fancy cup of
hot chocolate.<br>
<br>
<br>
<img src="images/iceland/stykkisholmur/iceland%20175.jpg" alt=""><br>
We arranged our island trip. &nbsp;Elfa's family actually owns an
island in this area, but it would have meant a multi-day visit and we
felt only up for a day trip. &nbsp;We secured passage on a ferry that
stops at an island named "Flatey". &nbsp;We heard we'd get to try a
homemade meal of European shag, which all of us agreed would be a
unique experience. &nbsp;Elfa thought the name "shag" was funny, so we
descended into a fury of Austin Powers quotes.<br>
<br>
<br>

Luis is quite a photographer. &nbsp;He actually took a photography
course. &nbsp;I should one day. &nbsp;Anyway, while I carried around my
Canon pocket camera, he was dragging around his high-end SLR hardware,
snapping pictures with a trigger finger quicker than a toad's tongue.<br>
<br>
<br>
<img src="images/iceland/stykkisholmur/iceland%20181.jpg" alt=""><br>
As we were preparing to depart to Flatey, we had plenty of an
opportunity to take pictures. &nbsp;This was the best of my 10
pictures. &nbsp;Luis took probably five times more.<br>
<br>
<br>
<img src="images/iceland/stykkisholmur/iceland%20185.jpg" alt=""><br>
We could take pictures of the workers shuffling across the dock.<br>
<br>
<br>

Rocky walls are laid in place to protect boats from the choppy waters.<br>

A pointy orange triangle, my last view of the Icelandic mainland as I was ferried off to Flatey.<br>
