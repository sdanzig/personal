<h1>Flatey</h1>

On the ferry heading to Flatey. &nbsp;It was a bit out of season, so
there were very few passengers on board. &nbsp;We weren't sure if there
was actually going to be ferry service today due to lack of passengers.<br>
<br>
<br>
<img src="images/iceland/flatey/iceland%20205.jpg" alt=""><br>
The waves slammed against the lower-deck windows.<br>
<br>
<br>
<img src="images/iceland/flatey/iceland%20210.jpg" alt=""><br>
On the upper deck, the wind was forceful and unforgiving. &nbsp;I had
to latch onto the rails to stay upright, but the views from up there
were well worth it, at least until I felt the chill bite into my skin.<br>
<br>
<br>
<img src="images/iceland/flatey/iceland%20218.jpg" alt=""><br>
Rocky little two-tone islands just off the coast of Flatey.<br>
<br>
<br>
<img src="images/iceland/flatey/iceland%20221.jpg" alt=""><br>
A lighthouse in the distance, with mountains even more in the distance.<br>
<br>
<br>
<img src="images/iceland/flatey/iceland%20226.jpg" alt=""><br>
We arrived at Flatey! &nbsp;Sailors move the exit ramp in position so we can walk off comfortably.<br>
<br>
<br>

This little car is designed to load cargo onto boats.<br>
<br>
<br>
<img src="images/iceland/flatey/iceland%20228.jpg" alt=""><br>
The lighthouse no longer in the distance. &nbsp;Mountains are still in the distance though.<br>
<br>
<br>
<img src="images/iceland/flatey/iceland%20229.jpg" alt=""><br>
Icelandic sailor. &nbsp;I liked his "Flatey" hat. &nbsp;He wears a hat that advertises this cold little island in the middle of nowhere. &nbsp;I can appreciate that.<br>
<br>

The side of the ferry that brought us here, showing the route it takes.
&nbsp;The ferry would continue on to its last stop, partially shown
here, then return to Flatey at a specified time. &nbsp;We would have to
be ready and waiting when the ferry arrived. &nbsp;Otherwise we would
be stuck on this cold little island till morning &nbsp;Sea Tours is the
name of the company that sells the tickets.<br>
<br>
<br>
<img src="images/iceland/flatey/iceland%20235.jpg" alt=""><br>
We're exploring Flatey now. &nbsp;Dry grass streaked with snow stretches to the surrounding sea.<br>
<br>
<br>
<img src="images/iceland/flatey/iceland%20238.jpg" alt=""><br>
Bye ferry! &nbsp;Please remember to pick us up!<br>
<br>
<br>
<img src="images/iceland/flatey/iceland%20241.jpg" alt=""><br>
Fish is left out to dry on this wooden rack.<br>
<br>
<br>
<img src="images/iceland/flatey/iceland%20244.jpg" alt=""><br>
The island also had its fair share of large patches of ice.<br>
<br>
<br>
<img src="images/iceland/flatey/iceland%20247.jpg" alt=""><br>
Mountains seemed so close, all around us, but there was no way to reach
them. &nbsp;Not that we wanted to reach them. &nbsp;Seemed even colder
on the mountains.<br>
<br>
<br>
<img src="images/iceland/flatey/iceland%20251.jpg" alt=""><br>
We see these buildings along the one road on the island.<br>
<br>
<br>
<img src="images/iceland/flatey/iceland%20253.jpg" alt=""><br>
Using my camera's zoom, I was able to snap a picture of these other
buildings on the far side of the island. &nbsp;To the left is the
residential area. &nbsp;Like the church in Reykjavik, this island's
church was also under construction.<br>
<br>
<br>
<img src="images/iceland/flatey/iceland%20256.jpg" alt=""><br>
We walked a little further to see the houses of Flatey. &nbsp;Most of
these are summer homes. &nbsp;Very few people (3 or 4) live on the
island during the winter.<br>
<br>
<br>
<img src="images/iceland/flatey/iceland%20259.jpg" alt=""><br>
Eventually you recognize beauty even in icy patches, being on an island without people.<br>
<br>
<br>

Part of a ship serving as a monument to Flatey's fishermen.<br>
<br>
<br>
<img src="images/iceland/flatey/iceland%20263.jpg" alt=""><br>
Cutest post office ever. &nbsp;I think the postman here should be given a smartcar to match it.<br>
<br>
<br>
<img src="images/iceland/flatey/iceland%20270.jpg" alt=""><br>
Perhaps they can't decide what to put on a sign of such permanence.<br>
<br>
<br>
<img src="images/iceland/flatey/iceland%20272.jpg" alt=""><br>
These sheep know that the scenery would only be half as good without their agricultural charm.<br>
<br>
<br>
<img src="images/iceland/flatey/iceland%20275.jpg" alt=""><br>
One sheep wonders how I could possibly survive without lots of wool.<br>
<br>
<br>
<img src="images/iceland/flatey/iceland%20282.jpg" alt=""><br>
Ya know, Ernie, them mountains are really something. &nbsp;I just love looking at those mountains.<br>
<br>
<br>
<img src="images/iceland/flatey/iceland%20283.jpg" alt=""><br>
All you do all day is go on and on about those damn mountains, Albert!
&nbsp;I'm sick of it! &nbsp;Would walk away from you if it weren't so
damn cold. &nbsp;Nice earring though!<br>
<br>
<br>
<img src="images/iceland/flatey/iceland%20290.jpg" alt=""><br>
Sheep poop.<br>
<br>
<br><img src="images/iceland/flatey/iceland%20298.jpg" alt=""><br>On
Flatey, there's a small old cemetary. &nbsp;People connected to Flatey
were buried there. &nbsp;You have to admit, this scenery sure beats
that cemetary near the mall.<br><br><br>
<img src="images/iceland/flatey/iceland%20292.jpg" alt=""><br>
Last names that end with "dottir" are very Icelandic. &nbsp;We saw a lot of them.<br>
<br>
<br>
<img src="images/iceland/flatey/iceland%20294.jpg" alt=""><br>
Some of the headstones with older Icelandic script reminded me of those
puzzles where each letter maps to another letter. &nbsp;The only thing
is, it looks like one big word. &nbsp;Maybe it's some sort of printing
block, where if you want to transcribe a letter on your poster, you
align the paper then do a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravestone_rubbing">rubbing</a> of it.<br>
<br>
<br>
<img src="images/iceland/flatey/iceland%20296.jpg" alt=""><br>
The better fisherman you were, the more your tombstone stands out.<br>
<br>
<br>
<img src="images/iceland/flatey/iceland%20300.jpg" alt=""><br>
There were numerous signs that these graves are looked after
diligently. &nbsp;Honestly, there's only so much to do on the island,
so instead of catching the latest movie, resident folks might go for a
walk with their pet sheep and have a chat with their dearly departed on
the way. &nbsp;Okay, probably not.<br>
<br>
<br>
<img src="images/iceland/flatey/iceland%20301.jpg" alt=""><br>
Here's a symbol at the cemetary gateway that conveys to graverobbers a
hint of who they're messing with. &nbsp;I can't imagine too many
graverobbers looting this island anyway. &nbsp;I mean, it's much easier
just to hit the cemetary near the mall.<br>
<br>
<br>
<img src="images/iceland/flatey/iceland%20303.jpg" alt=""><br>
The church, sporting the most expensive door on Flatey,&nbsp; has been going through renovation during the offseason.<br>
<br>
<br>
<img src="images/iceland/flatey/iceland%20305.jpg" alt=""><br>
Just like in Stykkishólmur, here's another chart table showing the distance and direction to various points around Iceland.<br>
<br>
<br>
<img src="images/iceland/flatey/iceland%20306.jpg" alt=""><br>
Barbed wire fences run along a snowy ditch.<br>
<br>
<br>
<img src="images/iceland/flatey/iceland%20309.jpg" alt=""><br>
We approach the houses of Flatey.<br>
<br>
<br><img src="images/iceland/flatey/iceland%20332.jpg" alt=""><br>Félagshús is a historic&nbsp;hús, being the oldest&nbsp;hús in Flatey. &nbsp;According to the sign, it was built in 1843.<br><br><br><img src="images/iceland/flatey/iceland%20333.jpg" alt=""><br>I
invaded the privacy of the historic Félagshús, taking a picture through
the window. &nbsp;That chair has to be bad for the back.<br><br><br>
<img src="images/iceland/flatey/iceland%20316.jpg" alt=""><br>
In case of emergency, everyone in Flatey must crowd into this little
boat. &nbsp;According to the sign, this little area is a historic
preservation area dated back to 1833.<br>
<br>
<br>
<img src="images/iceland/flatey/iceland%20318.jpg" alt=""><br>
Here's "the sign" I've been referring to. &nbsp;Do some reading on your own. &nbsp;I'm tired.<br>
<br>
<br>
<img src="images/iceland/flatey/iceland%20320.jpg" alt=""><br>
This, according to that sign, is a "breakwater", which definitely looks
like it's designed to keep a small area of water protected from the
whims of the Atlantic.<br>
<br>
<br><img src="images/iceland/flatey/iceland%20342.jpg" alt=""><br>When
the travel to the lighthouse is needed and the sea is calm enough,
someone can take a little boat out of the breakwater and make a run for
it.<br><br>&nbsp;<br>
<img src="images/iceland/flatey/iceland%20329.jpg" alt=""><br>
As restless as the water is for attention, face it, everyone would
prefer to see the mountains and clouds, so I adjusted the exposure
accordingly.<br>
<br>
<br>
<img src="images/iceland/flatey/iceland%20336.jpg" alt=""><br>
This man is proud to be a captain. &nbsp;I really hope he's a captain and not just trying to fit in.<br>
<br>
<br>
<img src="images/iceland/flatey/iceland%20337.jpg" alt=""><br>
Here's a really well-insulated roof that's a pain in the ass to
maintain. &nbsp;However, if the roof is barely higher than the front
door, maybe it's not so bad.<br>
<br>
<br>
<img src="images/iceland/flatey/iceland%20348.jpg" alt=""><br>
We were promised a home-cooked meal of European shag on this island.
&nbsp;At a certain time afterward, we had to be waiting for the ferry
or we would be stuck on the island. &nbsp;The problem is, we didn't
know which house to go to for the food and had only so much time to eat
and get back to the dock. &nbsp;We first tried peeking in a few windows
and knocking on a few doors, including one that looked like Flatey's
only restaurant. &nbsp;Elfa tried her cell phone a few times, trying to
get in touch with the ones who arranged the dinner, wanting directions.
&nbsp;Meanwhile, we were really cold. &nbsp;I had to keep moving around
to stay warm. &nbsp;The cold was reaching my core through my four
layers.<br>
<br>
<br>
<img src="images/iceland/flatey/iceland%20360.jpg" alt=""><br>
We did our best to distract ourselves from the cold and our impending doom, immersing ourselves in a never-ending onslaught of photography.<br>
<br>
<br>
<img src="images/iceland/flatey/iceland%20363.jpg" alt=""><br>
If the temperature was slightly colder, perhaps the sea would have froze up and we could have skated back to the mainland.<br>
<br>
<br>
<img src="images/iceland/flatey/iceland%20370.jpg" alt=""><br>
We went back to the sheep and considered unorthodox ways to stay warm.
&nbsp;Apparently chickens had the same idea, and we didn't want to
stoop down to their level.<br>
<br>
<br>
<img src="images/iceland/flatey/iceland%20377.jpg" alt=""><br>
Finally we found the right place to go to.<br>
<br>
<br>
<img src="images/iceland/flatey/iceland%20379.jpg" alt=""><br>
This map of Flatey would have been more useful before we arrived.<br>
<br>
<br>
<img src="images/iceland/flatey/iceland%20380.jpg" alt=""><br>
Finally dinner was served. &nbsp;It wasn't European shag that was
served. &nbsp;The nice lady that cooked for us actually cooked "<span class="Apple-style-span" style="border-collapse: separate; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: arial,sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal; orphans: 2; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; font-size: small;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="border-collapse: collapse; font-size: 17px; white-space: pre;">cormorant" instead.  Never heard of this bird before I ate one.  We also had fresh cheese and homemade bread with butter.</span></span><br>
<br>
<br>
<img src="images/iceland/flatey/iceland%20383.jpg" alt=""><br>
Also rice and veggies and potatoes. &nbsp;Soaking up the gravy the bird was served with was scrumptious. <br>
<br>
<br>
<img src="images/iceland/flatey/iceland%20384.jpg" alt=""><br>
Here's a closeup of the potatoes. &nbsp;I'm hungry again.<br>
<br>
<br>
<img src="images/iceland/flatey/iceland%20386.jpg" alt=""><br>
Our meal was prepared here. &nbsp;I have to admit, this is a classy kitchen.<br>
<br>
<br>
<img src="images/iceland/flatey/iceland%20387.jpg" alt=""><br>
Here's a picture of me with my four layers on, Luis to the left, and
the resident chef in the middle. &nbsp;She was also selling some
Icelandic wool socks, hats, and gloves. &nbsp;I bought socks from her
for myself, and gloves for my girlfriend who was hopefully much warmer
than I was at the moment. &nbsp;I just wanted to make sure I wouldn't
be as cold ever again, and after seeing the sheep, I figured wool was
the way to go.<br>
<br>
<br>
<img src="images/iceland/flatey/iceland%20388.jpg" alt=""><br>
We barely made it to the dock in time, but the ferry wouldn't have been too quick to leave.<br>
<br>
<br>
<img src="images/iceland/flatey/iceland%20389.jpg" alt=""><br>
The ferry couldn't align itself too well with the dock, so they
couldn't hook up the ladder to the doorway. &nbsp;We had to hop over a
gap to get aboard. &nbsp;Here's them helping Elfa. &nbsp;Elfa has too
much pride not to be embarrassed at this "damsel in distress" photo-op.<br>
<br>
<br>
<img src="images/iceland/flatey/iceland%20392.jpg" alt=""><br>
We're speeding away from Flatey. &nbsp;As is frequently with my
adventures, the experience was traumatic but in the end, definitely
worth it. &nbsp;The sun lights up the faces of the shrinking structures
on the island, including the church.<br>
<br>
<br>
<img src="images/iceland/flatey/iceland%20411.jpg" alt=""><br>
Luis took a picture with the rusty hook in the foreground too.<br>
<br>
<br>
<img src="images/iceland/flatey/iceland%20412.jpg" alt=""><br>
Luis and I were having a battle of picture-taking. &nbsp;Elfa quickly grew tired of our juvenile amusements.<br>
<br>
<br>
<img src="images/iceland/flatey/iceland%20417.jpg" alt=""><br>
You can really see get a sense of the sea's shape when the sun is setting.<br>
<br>
<br>
<img src="images/iceland/flatey/iceland%20424.jpg" alt=""><br>
Clouds covered most of the sun as it set, but I'm sure it wouldn't have compared to Mount Fuji anyway. &nbsp;So there.<br><br><br>
