<body><h1>The Golden Circle</h1><br><br><img src="images/iceland/golden_circle/iceland%20798.jpg" alt=""><br>We
rented a car and Luis took the wheel. &nbsp;The plan was the fabled
"Golden Circle", which could be the top tourism attraction in Iceland.
&nbsp;It consisted of hot springs with gushing geysers, a lake in a
crater, and Gulfoss, a majestic waterfall. &nbsp;Also there was a
national park, Þingvellir, that was quite beautiful during the summer,
with lush trees and sparkling lakes. &nbsp;It was winter, so when we
stopped at the park, it looked different but still wowed us.<br><br><br><img src="images/iceland/golden_circle/iceland%20801.jpg" alt=""><br>A stream under a footbridge was littered with wishes.<br><br><br><img src="images/iceland/golden_circle/iceland%20808.jpg" alt=""><br>Snow surrounds the stream of mirrored sky.<br><br><br><img src="images/iceland/golden_circle/iceland%20810.jpg" alt=""><br>The stream splits and swerves on its way to the old church in the distance.<br><br><br><img src="images/iceland/golden_circle/iceland%20816.jpg" alt=""><br>Railed walkways connect a walkway across the peaceful landscape. <br><br><br><img src="images/iceland/golden_circle/iceland%20818.jpg" alt=""><br>We
realized we could have driven right instead of left and ended up on a
road on top of this pile of rock. &nbsp;Instead, we followed a path
leading gradually up to the top, with a little frozen waterfall to
steal icicles from along the way.<br><br><br><img src="images/iceland/golden_circle/iceland%20825.jpg" alt=""><br>On
the path a black dog led us to this brightly colored family. &nbsp;I
heard them call for the dog and told the name to Luis. &nbsp;I heard
the father say it was the word for "lucky". &nbsp;I hope the name
the unfrozen waterfall. &nbsp;While I mentioned a frozen one, this one
was not completely frozen, and thus it was unsafe to grab its icicles.<br><br><br><img src="images/iceland/golden_circle/iceland%20835.jpg" alt=""><br>More rocky hillsides as we trudged back down to our car.<br><br><br><img src="images/iceland/golden_circle/iceland%20841.jpg" alt=""><br>Our
next stop was Kerið, the volcanic crater lake. &nbsp;It's easily
recognizable as a former volcano opening because of its preserved
"caldera", so that's why it's famous. &nbsp;Wikipedia told me that, not
this billboard. &nbsp;The main purpose of the billboard is to let you
see the lake...<br><br><br><img src="images/iceland/golden_circle/iceland%20846.jpg" alt=""><br>...because
when we arrived, it was covered with snow. &nbsp;Still quite visually
appealing with one side of the wall contrasting with the brightly-lit
lake.<br><br><br><img src="images/iceland/golden_circle/iceland%20849.jpg" alt=""><br>Next stop was Geysir the geyser, which all geysers were named after. &nbsp;Here was a restaurant near the hot springs.<br><br><br><img src="images/iceland/golden_circle/iceland%20851.jpg" alt=""><br>This was no time for food. &nbsp;We saw things erupting loudly in the distance and ran over to see.<br><br><br><img src="images/iceland/golden_circle/iceland%20855.jpg" alt=""><br>Steamy hot water trickled through the snow. &nbsp;I was worried I could get burnt by this water.<br><br><br><img src="images/iceland/golden_circle/iceland%20861.jpg" alt=""><br>First steamy hole sighted.<br><br><br><img src="images/iceland/golden_circle/iceland%20865.jpg" alt=""><br>Awww.<br><br><br><img src="images/iceland/golden_circle/iceland%20866.jpg" alt=""><br>Here's Little Geysir. &nbsp;It bubbled a lot but didn't erupt much.<br><br><br><img src="images/iceland/golden_circle/iceland%20867.jpg" alt=""><br>In the distance we see a massive explosion again! &nbsp;Screw these little holes. &nbsp;Wait, bad phrasing.<br><br><br><img src="images/iceland/golden_circle/iceland%20871.jpg" alt=""><br>Lots of tourists walking away from Geysir (the big one which the word "geyser" comes from).<br><br><br><img src="images/iceland/golden_circle/iceland%20872.jpg" alt=""><br>The most active and thus most prominent large geysir was Strokkur.<br><br><br><img src="images/iceland/golden_circle/iceland%20873.jpg" alt=""><br>Tourists
walked over to Strokkur frequently. &nbsp;It erupted once every five to
ten minutes or so. &nbsp;Those who hadn't seen Strokkur before jumped
or even yelped at the power of the eruption. &nbsp;I didn't feel safe
being so close either, but I was a jumper, NOT a yelper.<br><br><br><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dIIxUx9Bek"><img style="border: 0px solid ; width: 800px; height: 600px;" src="images/iceland/golden_circle/iceland%20878.jpg" alt=""></a><br>I started to get pretty good with telling when the eruption was coming. &nbsp;Here's a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dIIxUx9Bek">video</a> of the eruption I managed to take a video of.<br><br><br><img src="images/iceland/golden_circle/iceland%20880.jpg" alt=""><br>The
way the ice formed around the geysir was peculiar. &nbsp;At first I
pictured drops of falling water freezing at the ground, but I think
more realistic is the steam rising up underneath the snow to melt some
of it, leaving behind little towers of ice.<br><br><br><img src="images/iceland/golden_circle/iceland%20889.jpg" alt=""><br>Luis
and I became a bit braver around these geysers. &nbsp;I mean, you'd get
burned if you stuck your head right over the geyser and let it erupt
into your face, it didn't seem very dangerous at all to just snap a
quicky while it was resting.<br><br><br><img src="images/iceland/golden_circle/iceland%20892.jpg" alt=""><br>This little hole wasn't going to erupt at all, but it glowed a shade of blue that was easy to lose yourself in.<br><br><br><img src="images/iceland/golden_circle/iceland%20898.jpg" alt=""><br>Fortunately
I didn't dive in all together, but I couldn't resist putting my hand
in. &nbsp;See? &nbsp;The bandage is still there, which proves it's my
hand. &nbsp;To be fair, Luis stuck his hand in first, so maybe I'm not
as brave. &nbsp;You can see more wishes at the bottom.<br><br><br><img src="images/iceland/golden_circle/iceland%20900.jpg" alt=""><br>Geysir,
the king of all geysers. &nbsp;We waited some time, but it didn't get
close to erupting during our visit. &nbsp;Supposedly it doesn't erupt
for years at times. &nbsp;This must have been one of those years.<br><br><br><img src="images/iceland/golden_circle/iceland%20903.jpg" alt=""><br>While it was not showing many signs of agitation, it was still too steamy to see through.<br><br><br><img src="images/iceland/golden_circle/iceland%20909.jpg" alt=""><br>Unlike most tourists, trolls in Iceland don't complain about the cold.<br><br><br><img src="images/iceland/golden_circle/iceland%20910.jpg" alt=""><br>They
have thick shocks of hair and Icelandic flags to stay warm. &nbsp;When
they get too cold, they cuddle together. &nbsp;And if you're lucky...<br><br><br><img src="images/iceland/golden_circle/iceland%20911.jpg" alt=""><br>...a troll will cuddle you!<br><br><br><img src="images/iceland/golden_circle/iceland%20912.jpg" alt=""><br>On to the final show. &nbsp;Gulfoss is major eye-candy.<br><br><br><img src="images/iceland/golden_circle/iceland%20939.jpg" alt=""><br>Rainbows frequently arced through the mist above the falls.<br><br><br><img src="images/iceland/golden_circle/iceland%20949.jpg" alt=""><br>If you drop your camera into the falls, it's a good time to upgrade to one with a handstrap.<br><br><br><img src="images/iceland/golden_circle/iceland%20955.jpg" alt=""><br>A
dude wanted his picture taken in front of Gulfoss. &nbsp;Naturally, he
returned the favor, so here's the same spot where I took a picture of
him.<br><br><br><img src="images/iceland/golden_circle/iceland%20956.jpg" alt=""><br>The&nbsp;hillside near the falls was covered in cauliflower.<br><br><br><img src="images/iceland/golden_circle/iceland%20957.jpg" alt=""><br>Waterfalls
always seem more dramatic than they actually are. &nbsp;I remember the
hurricane deck at Niagara falls. &nbsp;I saw the loud and scary water
and nervously walked towards it. &nbsp;But it didn't throw me into the
air or even sting my skin. &nbsp;Felt like nothing more than a heavy
rainfall. &nbsp;The real danger of a waterfall is if you end up in the
water. &nbsp;It's very difficult to fight current, and your life would
be in grave danger. &nbsp;This water was very cold too, so I didn't try
it.<br><br><br><img src="images/iceland/golden_circle/iceland%20971.jpg" alt=""><br>Rainbows were appearing in different spots as the sun began to set.<br><br><br><img src="images/iceland/golden_circle/iceland%20974.jpg" alt=""><br>It was bedtime for Gulfoss as he pulled his blanket of shadows over him.<br><br><br><img src="images/iceland/golden_circle/iceland%20986.jpg" alt=""><br>A&nbsp;full rainbow halo appeared over the innocent waterfall as it fell into a snoring slumber.<br><br><br><br><a href="iceland.html">Back</a></body></html>
