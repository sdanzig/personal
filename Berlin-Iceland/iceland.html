tried her best to hold her
smile despite the icy temperatures of Berlin. &nbsp;Perhaps it was the
realization that she wouldn't be following me to the even colder
ICEland. &nbsp;That theory about Iceland being green and Greenland
being ice is half right. &nbsp;Iceland is a buoy of ice in the
Atlantic, tortured by icy winds but occasionally visited by cute and
furry polar bears, where they get <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2008/jun/05/animalwelfare.animalbehaviour">shot</a>. &nbsp;<a href="http://www.sikunews.com/art.html?artid=5035&amp;catid=2">Both of them</a>.
&nbsp;Very cold place. &nbsp;That said, the country is beautiful, the
culture is colorful, and the people are friendly. &nbsp;There's a
unique character to the people there. &nbsp;They have an aura of inner
peace, despite their <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008%E2%80%932009_Icelandic_financial_crisis">troubles</a>.
&nbsp;I found Icelanders particularly appreciative of nature.
&nbsp;It's easy to see how the mountains and landscapes can help define
a people.<br><br>The real impetus behind me thinking about Iceland was
the Northern Lights. &nbsp;I heard that they were most active around
late March, and although there's certainly nothing guaranteed, I
figured it was something to shoot for. &nbsp;Even if I didn't see them,
I'd make sure there were enough other things to make for a great
adventure.<br><br><br><a href="reykjavik.html">Reykjavík</a><br><br><a href="stykkisholmur.html">Stykkishólmur</a><br><br><a href="flatey.html">Flatey</a><br><br><a href="borgarnes.html">Borgarnes</a><br><br><a href="golden_circle.html">The Golden Circle</a><br><br><br><br><a href="index.html">Back</a></div></body></html>
