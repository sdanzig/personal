<body><h1>Heathrow Airport</h1><br><br><img src="images/heathrow/heathrow-002.JPG" alt=""><br>The
way the trip was planned, I was to fly from Boston to London to Berlin
to London to Reykjavík to London and back to Boston. &nbsp;So, you can
imagine I became well acquainted with Terminal 5 of Heathrow airport.
&nbsp;Heathrow
airport takes a lot of flak, but it has a very spacious feel to it, and
it's not unpleasant to look at. &nbsp;It's a little crowded though.
&nbsp;Next time I go there, I'm going to try out the Gordon Ramsay
restaurant "Plane Food".<br><br><br><img src="images/heathrow/heathrow-001.JPG" alt=""><br>Here's
where people get to wait for their flights. &nbsp;It's nice to be able
to stare at the big planes rolling by. &nbsp;Those planes you see here
are marked with the British Airways logo.<br><br><br><a href="index.html"><img src="images/heathrow/heathrow-003.JPG" alt=""></a><br>This
Ferrari was up for grabs, as long as you pony up a winning raffle
ticket. &nbsp;Right. &nbsp;So behind it is a "Giraffe" restaurant.
&nbsp;The food was good and affordable. &nbsp;Because British Airways
got the timing wrong on a connecting flight, they gave me a gift
certificate to spend on food and drinks in Heathrow. &nbsp;I spent it
here.<br><br><br><br><a href="index.html">Back</a><br></body></html>
