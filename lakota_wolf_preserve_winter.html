end up in a festive lickfest. &nbsp;From what I hear, one wolf, is
going up to the other and requesting a regurgitation of food. &nbsp;The
needy wolf is 8 years old, and thus way too old to be doing that.<br><br><br><img src="images/lakota_wolf_preserve/winter/timber_wolves_arrive_for_food.jpg" alt=""><br>More timber wolves arrive from the depths of the preserve, wanting some grub.<br><br><br><img src="images/lakota_wolf_preserve/winter/timber_wolf_sees_you.jpg" alt=""><br>Grub, here, now.<br><br><br><img src="images/lakota_wolf_preserve/winter/timber_wolf_hungry.jpg" alt=""><br>This timber wolf looks even hungrier.<br><br><br><img src="images/lakota_wolf_preserve/winter/timber_wolf_eating.jpg" alt=""><br>The
wolves are fed immediately. &nbsp;Wolves in this preserve get much
better service than humans get in restaurants, yet never leave tips.<br><br><br><img src="images/lakota_wolf_preserve/winter/red_fox_walking.jpg" alt=""><br>There
was an interesting story they told about how a red fox can get rid of
fleas. &nbsp;They've been known to carry a stick as they walk slowly
out into the water, giving fleas a chance to climb up to dry fur.
&nbsp;They point their noses up, still biting the stick, immersing
themselves gradually down. &nbsp;The fleas make their way to the fox's
nose. &nbsp;They get grumpy about the cramped accomodations, proceeding
to spread out across the stick. &nbsp;A fox then lets the stick go and
waves farewell at the fleas with its paw. &nbsp;Okay, I made the waving
part up, but the rest is true.<br><br><br><img src="images/lakota_wolf_preserve/winter/red_fox_running.jpg" alt=""><br>Of
course, these tykes are speedy devils. &nbsp;You don't understand how
difficult it was to take this picture. &nbsp;By the time the shutter
button was pressed all the way down, the fox was already driving off
with my car.<br><br><br><img src="images/lakota_wolf_preserve/winter/black_fox_standing.jpg" alt=""><br>This
is a red fox. &nbsp;You can imagine how confused this fox is. &nbsp;You
apparently can tell its a red fox by the white tip of the tail, which
you can't see in any of my pictures. &nbsp;You'll just have to trust me.<br><br><br><img src="images/lakota_wolf_preserve/winter/black_fox_clinging.jpg" alt=""><br>No matter what the color, foxes are all up for a good meal. &nbsp;They're also very cuddly, for a wild animal that is.<br><br><br><img src="images/lakota_wolf_preserve/winter/bobcat_poses.jpg" alt=""><br>Bobcats are not as cuddly. &nbsp;They're cold and calculating.<br><br><br><img src="images/lakota_wolf_preserve/winter/bobcat_eats_snow.jpg" alt=""><br>Perhaps this is because of all the snow they eat.<br><br><br><br><a href="lakota_wolf_preserve.html">Back</a><br><br><br></div></body></html>
