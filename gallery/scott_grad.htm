<p>Here's me in my cap and gown, about to leave the house for New York.&nbsp; 
I'm in my parents' driveway, if you couldn't tell.&nbsp; Look at how nicely I 
have ironed my gown.&nbsp; It was very wrinkly at first.&nbsp; Well, the 
instructions for ironing the gown says to turn it inside out first, which I did.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
I'm not sure exactly why, but I think there were dark spots that formed on the 
outside of the gown after I ironed it (none on the inside).&nbsp; I think the 
heat might have been too high, but anyway, I was nervous about the dark spots.&nbsp; 
A new gown costs $292, and $46 just to rent.&nbsp; I thought because of my 
little mistake, I might have been out three hundred dollars.&nbsp; So at the 
time of this picture, I was worried my mother would notice the spots.&nbsp; She 
didn't.&nbsp; Later I found little things wrong with the gown that I was certain 
I didn't cause, so I figured it was no big deal returning the gown as is, being 
that it was still wearable and I wasn't even sure if I damaged the gown at all.</p>

<p>Here's my parents wanting to pose before we left.&nbsp; My mother is very 
happy about this picture.&nbsp; She likes the fact that she showed up pretty 
well, and my dad didn't make a goofy face for once.&nbsp; Might I note that I 
think my mother has a nice outfit on.</p>

<p>Here's me standing in front of the most famous building at Columbia 
University's campus, the &quot;Low Library&quot;.&nbsp; The engineers who designed the 
library did not account for the weight of the books, and so the building started 
to sink when they were added.&nbsp; They had to build another library, and to 
this day, use the Low Library as a monstrous administrative building.</p>

<p>Here's me and my brother, Rob.&nbsp; Keep in mind, the sun is rather bright, 
so that's why we're somewhat squinting in so many of these pictures.&nbsp; I'm 
just happy my mother aimed the camera right.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Here's my and my dad in this pose set up by my mother who was still trying to 
figure out my camera.&nbsp; My dad looks a bit too serious here.&nbsp; His 
stylish hat made him very easy to find in the crowd, let me add.</p>

<p>This is a view of the friends and family of the Columbia engineering 
graduates, seated, watching the &quot;Engineering Class Day&quot; ceremony.&nbsp; You can 
see one of the Columbia University campus buildings towering overhead.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>This shows more buildings surrounding the ceremony, which took place at the 
&quot;South Lawn&quot;, which is a grassy field between the Low Library and the Butler 
Library which sits in front of and downhill from it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Yes, my mother held the camera perfectly straight here.&nbsp; I think the 
angled shot looks cool anyway.&nbsp; This is, of course, another building on 
campus.&nbsp; The blue banners hung along the building wall were I believe 
decorative for the ceremony.&nbsp; There were four of them.&nbsp; You can see 
some of the people watching the ceremony at the bottom.&nbsp; Strangely, two of 
them are covering their faces with paper.&nbsp; It was hot out so they might 
have also been fanning themselves, but there was another picture taken not long 
after this one which I tossed which showed the sheets of paper in the same exact 
position</p>

<p>This is a humorous story.&nbsp; So I'm walking up towards the stage to shake 
hands with the dean.&nbsp; My mother wants to take a picture of me on the way, 
with my digital camera.&nbsp; I think she pressed a stray button or something, 
because she tried about 4 times and the camera never beeped (which it does when 
a picture is taken).&nbsp; I got really pissed, because I was posing for each of 
her attempts to take a picture, all while being shoved along by the other 
graduates.&nbsp; I eventually came up with an idea of what went wrong and yelled 
it to her.&nbsp; She was able to fix the camera and take a picture in time to 
catch me as shown here.&nbsp; For your convenience, I'm pointed out by the red 
arrow.</p>

<p>This is another picture of the students walking across the stage to shake 
hands with the dean, who is the red splotch to the left of the center.&nbsp; The 
walk was horribly screwed up when the cards with the names on them were out of 
order.&nbsp; Students sometimes were rushing across the stage, getting their 
picture taken by a photographer with a trigger finger faster than Billy the 
Kid's.&nbsp; The black splotch to the right of the dean was actually another guy 
who hosted the ceremony who I didn't know but wanted to shake my hand anyway.&nbsp; 
They called my name a bit fast and I felt I had to hurry to get on stage, but I 
made sure I gave the photographer plenty of time to get a decent shot of me 
shaking the dean's hand.&nbsp; They also gave us a gold pin in a little case 
(instead of the diploma) which supposed to look like gold but probably is a 
cheap, electroplated metal.&nbsp; Maybe I'll show a picture of it here when I 
have a camera that can handle it.</p>

<p>Lastly, here's a picture of the seating area after the ceremony.&nbsp; Beyond 
all the empty chairs, you can see a bright white tent and take my word for it 
that there are lots of people in and all around it.&nbsp; They're all scavenging 
for the free food during the reception, which consisted of cookies and crackers, 
cheeses, fruit, snack vegetables, cups of fruit cocktail, and some drinks, which 
due to the hot weather, were in very high demand.</p>
