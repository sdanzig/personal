<p align="center">One of our two cabins. Keith (left) and I stayed in one cabin. 
Miller (right) and Ray stayed in the other. To the rear you can see the slick 
balcony that the large glass door leads to.&nbsp; We got discounts because the 
huge orange lifeboats blocked a bit of the water view, but not much. You can see 
the top of the orange life boat cover at the bottom of the glass door. The beds 
were rather hard but mostly comfortable and I was able to fit my large suitcase 
under them.</p>

<p align="center">After dinner every night, we returned to our cabin to find a 
new towel animal made by an exceptionally bored room steward. This one was an 
elephant.</p>

<p align="center">This one was a monkey. My personal favorite.</p>

<p align="center">We grew to adore our dining room servers. They were always 
cheerful and attentive. The guy on the left--I forget his name--served our food.&nbsp; 
Believe me, that creepy smile never left his face once. On the right is our dear 
Macedonian waitress. She actually taught me the Macarena after hours, actually 
complimenting my dancing ability, plus she was very interested in learning more 
about Miller's Macedonian coworker.&nbsp; Macedonians are apparently rather 
rare.</p>

<p align="center">The Macedonian waitress's name is Tamara, pronounced like 
&quot;camera&quot;. According to Tamara, Macedonians eat lots of bread. Conveniently, she 
was our bread server, so she saw to it that we had at least one piece of bread 
before every meal. Let it be said that she also kept our glasses of iced tea and 
water filled to the brim.&nbsp; We tipped her well. Mostly because she's 28, 
single, and gave us her email address.</p>

<p align="center">During almost every dinner in the dining hall, they had 
&quot;entertainment&quot; for the evening. Often it was a simple dance that everyone took 
a break from their meals to join. Twice involved everyone twirling their napkins 
around during singing. Meanwhile, I decided to wait for Tamara to look towards 
me so I could blind her with my camera's flash. She was a bit annoyed.</p>

<p align="center">Here's another waitress, but I don't know her name. I do know 
she's from Thailand though. She served us drinks during dinner. It was hard to 
resist the daily &quot;special&quot; for only $2.95 + gratuity! Apparently I ordered two 
last night because she didn't hear me say no, so as punishment, she agreed to 
let me blind her too.</p>

<p align="center">I don't like country music, but like everyone else, I liked 
Carol! She had a nice set of... ummm... pipes.</p>

<p align="center">Darren was the pianist in the Shanghai Bar, as shown. On the 
night before the night shown, him and Carol performed together. That night's 
performance ended with some rather hot girl stroking Darren with her bra.</p>
