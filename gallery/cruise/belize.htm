<p align="center">The cruise ship couldn't dock at Belize's shore directly. It was too big. So 
here you see us zipping over to the shore in a &quot;tender&quot;.&nbsp; For those who 
know English well, you'd know this is a boat that takes you between the ship and 
the shore.</p>

<p align="center">In Belize, our destination was the Xunantunich temple near the border of 
Guatemala, which was near a 2 hour drive each way. The temperature outside 
during our entire cruise and shore excursions ranged between 80 and 90F... 
extremely pleasant.&nbsp; However, during this excursion, we drove away from the 
water, inland, and were stuck in a bus with air-conditioning that didn't work 
too well.&nbsp; We were really hot in there, in otherwords. Maybe that's why I 
ended up taking a picture of two Coca Cola signs. Anyway, going inland, houses 
got smaller and more run-down. I suspect we'd see the same in the other 
countries as well. This street seems pretty well off though. Note any words you 
see in the picture would be in English, because Belize has chosen English as its 
primary language.</p>

<p align="center">Here's a picture of what I guess are some citizens of Belize, and a few 
houses behind them.</p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center">

<p align="center">The cemetary looked strikingly different with the above-ground caskets.</p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center">
<img border="0" src="../../images/cruise/cruise-2003%20044.jpg" width="576" height="436"></p>
<p align="center">Here's a couple more of the houses. One thing that you'd definitely notice 
while taking the same tour is that the citizens of Belize are friendly people 
who like Americans. Quite a few of them waved to our tour bus as we drove by, 
and we of course waved back.</p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center">
<img border="0" src="../../images/cruise/cruise-2003%20045.jpg" width="576" height="436"></p>
<p align="center">I think this is some sort of general store, but I'm not sure, mostly because 
my camera's resolution sucks.</p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center">
<img border="0" src="../../images/cruise/cruise-2003%20046.jpg" width="576" height="436"></p>
<p align="center">The camera's shutter speed sucks too, but you can still see lots of pickup 
trucks in front of a marketplace.</p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>

<p align="center">Finally we reach the Xunantunich temple. This temple was built by the Mayans. 
I forget the year, but I'm sure you can look it up elsewhere. Xunantunich 
translates to &quot;stone lady&quot;, which is a name given to the temple by some locals 
that supposedly saw a lady float up the temple's side and disappear at the top. 
I, along with most of the other tourists, wondered what those locals were 
smoking. Just note that the name was not given to the temple by the Mayans who 
built it. So anyway, this is one of Belize's cherished treasures. Their 
appreciation came too little too late though. When they originally excavated the 
site, they sold off whatever they could for money, and there were a whole lot of 
looters too. Also one excavator even used dynamite to completely destroy the 
smaller structure which is to the right when facing the front of the temple, but 
blocked from your view by the structure that's directly in front of the temple, 
which you can see clearly here. I don't care if you didn't follow that. Just 
realize that if you face the temple, there's a hill to the right with destroyed 
ruins in it.</p>

<p align="center">Here we reach the front of the temple. The stairs go up only part way, and 
the Mayans, according to the tour guide, climbed them on both hands and knees. 
When you reach the top of the steps, you enter the temple and continue climbing 
via a staircase inside it.</p>

<p align="center">Here's a closer view of the temple, and you can even read a bit of the sign 
in front of it. Well, maybe you can't, because my camera sucks. However, you 
probably can make out that the temple is 130 feet. The tour guide told us 135, 
so she should be fired.</p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center">
<img border="0" src="../../images/cruise/cruise-2003%20051.jpg" width="576" height="436"></p>
<p align="center">This is the &quot;Western frieze&quot; of the temple. Each of those symbols have 
meanings, representing various gods the Mayans believed in.</p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center">

<p align="center">
Behold a view of Guatemala, less than a mile away from the Mayan temple. This 
means one guy hiding in the temple with an M16 rifle can handle any immigration 
problems Belize may have. Like Costa Rica's problem with Nicaragua, however, 
Belize still has problems with people sneaking into the country, because 
Guatemala is also not a very safe place to live.</p>

<img border="0" src="../../images/cruise/cruise-2003%20053.jpg" width="436" height="576"></p>
<p align="center">Here's a wonderful view of the Eastern frieze, along with the entire east 
side of the temple. Looks like it would hurt to fall of the top of that.</p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center">
<img border="0" src="../../images/cruise/cruise-2003%20054.jpg" width="436" height="576"></p>
<p align="center">Miller volunteered to demonstrate this. You can see him on top, clinging for 
his life, cursing every second I took when taking this picture.</p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center">
<img border="0" src="../../images/cruise/cruise-2003%20057.jpg" width="576" height="436"></p>
<p align="center">I finally made it up to the top myself, and here's a view of what it looks 
like to peer over the front edge (the north side).</p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center">
<img border="0" src="../../images/cruise/cruise-2003%20056.jpg" width="576" height="436"></p>
<p align="center">I forget which side of the temple this is.</p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center">
<img border="0" src="../../images/cruise/cruise-2003%20058.jpg" width="436" height="576"></p>
<p align="center">Here's an awesome picture northward from the temple. See how tiny tourists 
seem from 130 feet up.</p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center">
<img border="0" src="../../images/cruise/cruise-2003%20059.jpg" width="436" height="576"></p>
<p align="center">Here we go down the steps along the west side of the temple. From here we 
were able to see the Guatemala border only <font face="Times New Roman">¾</font> 
a mile away.</p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center">
<img border="0" src="../../images/cruise/cruise-2003%20060.jpg" width="576" height="436"></p>
<p align="center">Here's a tree near the temple. Those black spheres hanging from it are 
apparently ant nests. I thought ants only lived in anthills, so I took a 
picture.</p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center">
<img border="0" src="../../images/cruise/cruise-2003%20061.jpg" width="576" height="436"></p>
<p align="center">The black splotch in the middle of this picture is a termite's nest. I figure 
this is why the Mayans built their temple out of stone.</p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center">
<img border="0" src="../../images/cruise/cruise-2003%20062.jpg" width="436" height="576"></p>
<p align="center">Just some Mayan carvings found at this site.</p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center">
<img border="0" src="../../images/cruise/cruise-2003%20064.jpg" width="576" height="436"></p>
<p align="center">Here we return from the temple. To cross this river, we go on what's 
effectively a bridge. Let me describe this contraption. Two ropes act as guides 
for the bridge, and a crank on the left, behind the gray SUV, is umm.. 
cranked... manually, to push the bridge towards the other side of the water. 
Only one person was allowed in a vehicle while it was on the bridge. They 
allowed pedestrians on the bridge as well, but we had to stand in such a way 
that the platform was balanced. If we all stood on the front part, the bridge 
could not slide onto the far side. Why don't they just build a bridge, you might 
ask? Well, I asked this same question, and apparently they need to use this 
because the water level changes and they needed to compensate for that. Why 
can't they just build a higher bridge you might ask? I might guess it's because 
this is not a first-world nation, but maybe there's another reason that I'm not 
aware of.</p>

<p align="center">I guess these guys call themselves Los Angeles as in &quot;The Angels&quot;, not as in 
the Californian city. They provided music to entertain us while we ate authentic 
Belize cuisine consisting of rice and beans, chicken, fried plantain, and 
something that seemed like coleslaw, with mango juice to wash it all down. It 
was very good. Note the basket in front of them, obviously for tips. The music 
seemed very cheerful and it put me in a good mood, plus the guy in the middle 
smiled at me when I pointed my camera, so I gave them their first tip for the 
day. If you had dinner in this restaurant and did not tip them, shame on you.</p>
