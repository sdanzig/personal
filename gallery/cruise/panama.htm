<p align="center">Here we wear our life jackets and board our boats to travel across Gatun 
Lake.</p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center">
<img border="0" src="../../images/cruise/cruise-2003%20003.jpg" width="435" height="436"></p>
<p align="center">And we're off. Gatun Lake has manitees, crocodiles, lots of fish, etc. We saw 
a snail kite flying nearby, and it took forever to find a sloth sleeping in a 
tree.</p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center">
<img border="0" src="../../images/cruise/cruise-2003%20004.jpg" width="436" height="410"></p>
<p align="center">Can you find the sloth in this picture? Well, I'm sure I aimed the camera 
right, so keep looking.</p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center">
<img border="0" src="../../images/cruise/cruise-2003%20005.jpg" width="576" height="436"></p>
<p align="center">As we leave our boats and remove our life jackets, the tribe greets us with 
some cheerful music.</p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center">
<img border="0" src="../../images/cruise/cruise-2003%20006.jpg" width="576" height="436"></p>
<p align="center">The leader of the tribe tells us about his people and the area. He speaks 
only Spanish and some other ancient language, so the guy next to him in the 
white shirt translates for him. Mind you, that funky wooden hat of his was 
available at the souvenir shop for about $25, so it's easy to run your own 
tribe.</p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center">
<img border="0" src="../../images/cruise/cruise-2003%20007.jpg" width="576" height="436"></p>
<p align="center">The girls of the tribe boogie down in a circle while the men play more 
cheerful music.</p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center">
<img border="0" src="../../images/cruise/cruise-2003%20008.jpg" width="576" height="436"></p>
<p align="center">Yes, my camera stinks, so it's a little fuzzy. All these women are topless 
though, as you can see. They later pulled tourists onto the dance floor and 
dragged them around in a circle.</p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center">
<img border="0" src="../../images/cruise/cruise-2003%20009.jpg" width="576" height="436"></p>
<p align="center">We kept hearing an annoying rooster. I found it hiding under one of their 
structures. I'm not exactly sure what you'd call it. Maybe a raised gazebo. In 
another part of the village, you can see the tribe's normal clothes hanging on a 
clothesline. They apparently only dress in their costumes for tourists. Quite a 
shock.</p>

<p align="center">
<img border="0" src="../../images/cruise/cruise-2003%20010.jpg" width="429" height="436"></p>
<p align="center">The children have this game where one of them hangs on the rope, then the 
other shakes the rope until they fly off it. Stupid kids. Well, anyway, they go 
to school in two shifts. By doing this, they always have kids available for 
tourists to see.</p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center">
<img border="0" src="../../images/cruise/cruise-2003%20011.jpg" width="576" height="436"></p>
<p align="center">We went back onto Gatun Lake, going much faster this time, not stopping to 
observe the wildlife.</p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center">
<img border="0" src="../../images/cruise/cruise-2003%20012.jpg" width="576" height="436"></p>
<p align="center">Some of the housing in Panama.</p>

<p align="center">
<img border="0" src="../../images/cruise/cruise-2003%20014.jpg" width="576" height="436"></p>
<p align="center">And we've reached the Gatun Locks of the Panama Canal.&nbsp; There are 3 sets 
of locks, and the Gatun Locks are only one of them. The Miraflores Locks are 
another, and I forget the third. How these work is simple.&nbsp; In the 
distance, you can see a green and white ship heading towards Singapore, carrying 
5000 cars.&nbsp; The two &quot;locks&quot; you see here will open, the ship will sail 
through, then the locks will close and the water will be drained until the ship 
is around 80 feet lower, then another pair of doors (another lock) opens and the 
ship sails free. There are tracks on either side of the canal. On these you can 
see little yellow vehicles, two on each, connected to cables which block the 
front and back of each ship. At first we thought perhaps it helps support the 
ship, but it does not. The tour guide thought it supported the ship's weight 
entirely. She's a moron. But the best explanation I heard was that the cables 
kept the ship moving along steadily so it didn't bump into the other ships.</p>

<p align="center">This is a view of the water which will drain out as the ship is lowered. You 
can see the last of the Gatun Locks in the distance, and the tracks follow the 
canal downwards as well.</p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center">
<img border="0" src="../../images/cruise/cruise-2003%20016.jpg" width="576" height="436"></p>
<p align="center">This is a view of the water fully drained out.&nbsp; It's difficult to see, 
but the lock is opening here, and the ship is about to sail through.</p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center">
<img border="0" src="../../images/cruise/cruise-2003%20017.jpg" width="576" height="436"></p>
<p align="center">Here's another view of that oversized ship. If you look closely, you can see 
the cables in front of it.</p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center">
<img border="0" src="../../images/cruise/cruise-2003%20018.jpg" width="436" height="440"></p>
<p align="center">Ah, here's a very good picture of what I was talking about with the cables 
and tracks. The ship is happily heading out through the last of the Gatun Locks.&nbsp; 
Probably not too happy, actually, since this ship paid a couple hundred thousand 
dollars to pass through. The Panamanians charge based on mass.</p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center">
<img border="0" src="../../images/cruise/cruise-2003%20019.jpg" width="576" height="436"></p>
<p align="center">Here's a view of the main building/office complex/etc for the management of 
the Gatun Locks.</p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center">

<p align="center">You can see me in the back with the black hat, rather drunk from free mixed 
drink &quot;samples&quot; at the local grocery store, dancing with the natives. Amazingly, 
whoever I was dancing with seems completely blocked off from the picture, so I 
look pretty pathetic back there. My friends falsely claim I was dancing with a 
12 year old girl, but they're a bunch of idiots and I don't expect any better 
from them.</p>
