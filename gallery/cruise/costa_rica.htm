<p align="center">Here's a typical house behind a typical palm tree not far from the Caribbean 
coast of Costa Rica.</p>

<p align="center">I think we were passing over a very skinny bridge and I took a picture at the 
scenery below, but it doesn't look as impressive in this picture.</p>

<p align="center">This is another picture from the bus.&nbsp; Costa Rica enjoys lots of coastal 
flooding, and you can see the aftermath beyond the handful of trees.</p>

<p align="center">After biking to the beach in Costa Rica, we reached the beach. Stupid me 
still doesn't own a pair of sandals, so I walked out there doing the &quot;hot sand 
dance&quot;.&nbsp; Let me be clear about something though. This beach looked MUCH 
more impressive in person.&nbsp; The water here looks murky blue, but in person, 
it was perfectly clear turquoise water. I can describe it like greenish gefilte 
fish gel, but that would sound disgusting.&nbsp; The water was very salty 
though, and I learned that because of all the salt, it required no effort to 
stay afloat.&nbsp; We did a decent lot of swimming, and some people vacationing 
in the area had boats like shown.&nbsp; I saw one guy throw a stick into the 
water for his dog to fetch.&nbsp; It was too cute to watch with a straight face.</p>

<p align="center">Here's another picture of the beach, in the other direction... to the west I 
think. One more thing to note is that I felt very itchy later in the day after 
swimming in this water, and someone else I talked to felt the same.</p>

<p align="center">We stopped by one hotel for coffee and fruit.&nbsp; Not much of a meal, but 
the mango was good.&nbsp; They also had a pathetically small jacuzzi.&nbsp; The 
rooms of this hotel were a bunch of bungalows on stilts scattered throughout the 
trees.&nbsp; The idea was that they wanted it to blend in well, and they 
certainly achieved that.&nbsp; Anyway, what you see here is a pair of beds in 
one of the bungalows.&nbsp; I bet&nbsp; you didn't guess that.</p>

<p align="center">And here's a nice hammock you can rest in, obviously. I forget what that is 
behind it to the left, but I'll guess it's a lamp. The bungalows have electric 
power.</p>

<p align="center">They also have plumbing!</p>

<p align="center">Here's an outside view of one of the bungalows.&nbsp; I suppose it would have 
made more sense to show you this picture first, but I didn't want to bother 
rearranging them.</p>
