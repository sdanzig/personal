This is the main living room. You can see me on my sofa, sitting behind the 
coffee table.&nbsp; A chess board my parents got from Cancun sits on the coffee 
table.&nbsp; To the left, you see my kitchen table with a laptop and scanner on 
top of it (used as an overpriced fax machine at the time), and to the right, a 
collection of rarely used computer CDs.<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0" align="center">

This is another view of the living room.&nbsp; You can see the big recliner 
passed to me by my late grandparents.&nbsp; Other things to note in the room are 
the blinds that I chose and hung myself, the shield that I bought via eBay from 
Spain, and the fake plant that my parents thought was collecting way too much 
dust at their place, but seemed to fit very well at my apartment.&nbsp; My Mets 
and Devils caps hang near the stairwell for easy access.<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0" align="center">

Here's my computer setup which is in the corner of the living space.&nbsp; Two 
computers, one for Linux, one for Windows.&nbsp; You can see my undergraduate 
diploma hanging on the wall.&nbsp; Two more things to note.&nbsp; The moose lamp 
was one of many moose gifts given to me when people got wind of the fact that I 
admired the moose.&nbsp; Also, in the lower left, you can see a little blanket I 
picked up at Bed, Bath &amp; Beyond.&nbsp; It's extremely comfortable and handy for 
when you're falling asleep on the sofa, or a guest is cold.<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0" align="center">

This shows where I slept.&nbsp; I think I should have gotten a bigger comforter 
for my monstrous 18 inch thick Kingsdown mattress.&nbsp; For the little sleep 
that I managed to get, I was NOT about to compromise on my comfort.&nbsp; You 
can see my Trek dirt bike that I used to commute back and forth to class during 
college, and also two wall hangings, one of my favorite hockey team, the New 
Jersey Devils, and the other of one of my favorite animes, Rurouni Kenshin.<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0" align="center">

Here's another picture from my former bedroom.&nbsp; The huge ball is like those 
you can find at gyms lately.&nbsp; It's for workouts in other words.&nbsp; On 
the top of the chest you can see a wooden mask brought back from Costa Rica.&nbsp; 
It's not easy to hang, so it's been standing there dumbly instead, getting 
knocked over daily.&nbsp; You can see some anime-related pictures on the walls.&nbsp; 
The one on the left is rather interesting, because not only is it pleasing to 
look at, but every morning, when I woke up staring at it, I saw what appeared to 
be a face in a different part of the picture.&nbsp; It's sort of like seeing 
clouds shaped like different things.&nbsp; What I found amazing was that I must 
have seen nearly a hundred different &quot;faces&quot; in that one picture.&nbsp; The 
human mind can be fascinating at times, but mine in particular is fascinating 
ALL of the time.<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0" align="center">

This is the kitchen where I learned my cooking and baking skills.&nbsp; Many 
experiments were conducted in this room.&nbsp; The best part of this kitchen had 
to be the dishwasher.&nbsp; You'd be amazed at the things you can wash in there.&nbsp; 
Remember to use dishWASHER soap though, not just dish soap.&nbsp; The worst part 
of this kitchen was the fact that I didn't have a hood over the stove to suck 
away the fumes.&nbsp; A number of times I'd be in the situation where smoke was 
filling up the kitchen and the smoke alarm would go off, then I would have to 
annoy my neighbors by opening the windows.&nbsp; You can see my bonsai tree to 
the left, next to the window.&nbsp; If I'm not mistaken, you can also see a bag 
of flour in front of it.&nbsp; I must have been making something.<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0" align="center">

This shows yet more of my living room.&nbsp; You can see my 36 inch TV that I've 
fallen asleep in front of every other day.&nbsp; To the right, you can see my 
book case with some books for pleasure reading, some for work, and on the bottom 
is an encyclopedia set I got for very cheap.&nbsp; With the internet, who needs 
encyclopedias anymore?&nbsp; To the left of the TV is my patented shoe 
collection.&nbsp; It's nice just being able to step into your choice of shoes 
before you head out, but my mother kept saying how it looked ugly.&nbsp; Also, 
above the book case you can see a sword I bought in a Renaissance fair once, and 
to the right of it is a replica of the Rosetta Stone that I bought at the 
British Museum when I visited London.<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0" align="center">

This was my &quot;dining room&quot; area.&nbsp; You can see a dart board hanging up there 
too.&nbsp; I actually put a huge board behind the dart board, to protect the 
wall.&nbsp; With my friends' aim, I needed it.&nbsp; It was a little dangerous 
letting people throw darts there, because it was blocking off people coming out 
of the bathroom which is in that door to the left, but we were careful.<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0" align="center">
