<p>Lee and, well, Joe wasn't quite ready for the picture.&nbsp; Let's try again.</p>

<p>The camera is not good with dim lighting, but you can see inside the NJ 
Performing Arts Center.&nbsp; There were 4 tiers, and Lee's family got stuck on 
the third tier.&nbsp; The students are all in their caps and gowns, seated on 
the floor below.&nbsp; The Vs on their backs are the hoods hanging from their 
necks.</p>

<p>Here's Lee proudly standing in her cap and gown after receiving her diploma.&nbsp; 
We made a quick escape, wanting to avoid the traffic, but our plans got foiled 
as we ended up getting lost in Newark for half an hour anyway.</p>
