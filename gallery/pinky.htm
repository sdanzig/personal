&quot;Lord Pinkerton&quot; I can't explain, but &quot;Gdansk&quot; is the Polish name for the city 
&quot;Danzig&quot;, which has quite a history behind it, and is where my family name came 
from.&nbsp; This trooper lived 15<font face="Times New Roman">Â½ years, dying the 
night I got back from my college graduation ceremony at Rutgers.&nbsp; I wonder 
sometimes whether this dog hung on long enough to see that I made it through 
college.&nbsp; By the way, from all the dogs I've seen, westies are among the 
best out there.&nbsp; He's a harmless little dog, but he's not a wimp.&nbsp; 
These dogs were trained to hunt down and kill foxes.&nbsp; They're sturdy, and 
can play tug-of-war surprisingly well.&nbsp; You can lift a stuffed animal a 
westie is biting into high in the air and the little dog will dangle there for a 
good minute or two.&nbsp; Pinky even racked up a few kills, including my own 
parakeet, due to an unsightly accident.</font><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0" align="center">
