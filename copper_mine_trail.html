The scenery was stunning throughout the trail. While we had trouble
finding copper mines, we were temporarily sated by hypnotic landscapes
such as this one. <br>

The trail designer was smart enough to have this mine readily
accessible, so people who couldn't find the other mines wouldn't get
upset. However, we were still upset because they put a lock on the
gate. <br>

I still managed to slip my arm in to take a picture, as if we got
through the gate! <br>

A picturesque waterfall comforts us as we grow weary of our search for
copper mines. <br>

Well, the quick story is, we met up with other hikers that pointed us
in the right direction. Look, a tunnel into a copper mine! <br>

And after a bit of painstaking climbing on my part, then a bit more
climbing in the correct direction, we found this behemoth pit that
leads into the copper mine from above, compliments of a crapload of
dynamite.<br><br><br><br><a href="hikes.html">Back</a> </bold> </center>
