We arrived in London and had a mellow day figuring out the mass transit
options (the buses and the "Tube"), what the area around our apartment
had to offer, and some place to eat.&nbsp; I've been to London twice
before, so I had no problem sticking to the healthier food that Aliona
preferred.&nbsp; In this picture of Trafalgar Square, a massive
doubledecker bus posed for a shot, complete with Twilight's Kristin
Stewart, who many think Aliona resembles.<br>
<br>
<br>
<img src="images/england/england-2145.jpg" alt=""><br>

We stopped off at a geeky store, "Forbidden Planet", complete with menacing Sackboy action figures.<br>

<br>

<br>

<img src="images/england/england-2176.jpg" alt=""><br>

While posing in this typical London phone booth, Aliona was holding her breath.&nbsp; The scent was horrific.<br>

<br>

<br>

<img src="images/england/england-2178.jpg" alt=""><br>

I have nothing to do with the disgusting little ad posted next to me.<br>

<br>

<br clear="all">

<img src="images/england/england-2189.jpg" alt=""><br>

Big Ben, dark and ominous, looms in the distance.&nbsp; I like the word "loom", and if anything's going to loom, it's Big Ben.<br>

<br>

<br>

<img src="images/england/england-2191.jpg" alt=""><br>

The London "Eye" looms over the Thames River.<br>

<br>

<br>

<img src="images/england/england-2200.jpg" alt=""><br>

Aliona took a break from snacking on her stash of apples to pose on the Embankment Bridge.<br>

<br>

<br>

<img src="images/england/england-2207.jpg" alt=""><br>

We discovered there's a "champagne flight" option when riding the London Eye, which is just a fancy ferris wheel.<br>

<br>

<br>

<img src="images/england/england-2221.jpg" alt=""><br>

Of course we went for it.&nbsp; Here's our capsule "host" pouring the glasses for us shameless couples.<br>

<br>

<br>

<img src="images/england/england-2224.jpg" alt=""><br>

Up here you could see plenty of London, despite the typical clouds and
light rain.&nbsp; Our host was quick to dampen our spirits and let us
know we could have seen much more on a clear day.<br>

<br>

<br>

<img src="images/england/england-2232.jpg" alt=""><br>

Despite the rain, we certainly had a good view of all the pretty stuff in old London, especially Westminster.<br>

<br>

<br>

<img src="images/england/england-2233.jpg" alt=""><br>

Champagne hit the spot for a couple still fighting jetlag.<br>

<br>

<br>

<img src="images/england/england-2246.jpg" alt=""><br>

Speaking of which, we see this sign posted in the Tube station.&nbsp; That yellow dude likely has a bad liver anyway.<br>

<br>

<br>

<img src="images/england/england-2249.jpg" alt=""><br>

Aliona and I eat a lot of frozen yogurt in New York.&nbsp; I don't like
the taste of yogurt that much, and the best yogurt spot in London,
Snog, tasted way too yogurty for me.<br>

<br>

<br>

<img src="images/england/england-2253.jpg" alt=""><br>

The decorations in Snog were far more psychedelic than any froyo place I've seen.<br>

<br>

<br>

<img src="images/england/england-2254.jpg" alt=""><br>

We met up with a dude in the Brixton neighborhood (in London) at a fun
bar/hostel hangout called Hootananny.&nbsp; I seriously could not
recognize the gender of the middle backup singer.<br>

<br>

<br>

<img src="images/england/england-2261.jpg" alt=""><br>

At the Tower of London, I was trying to get a nice bird photo for what
Aliona will readily confirm was way too long.&nbsp; However, I later
realized a bird already showed up in this one.&nbsp; You probably have
to pay them bread for a second photo.<br>

<br>

<br>

<img src="images/england/england-2268.jpg" alt=""><br>

There was ice-skating at the Tower of London.&nbsp; When we decided to
go skating here later, the rink was gone and there was just a field of
grass.<br>

<br>

<br>

<img src="images/england/england-2286.jpg" alt=""><br>

In my last visit to London, the city was overrun by these
pidgeons.&nbsp; Due to time of year, these little they were few and far
between, thankfully.<br>

<br>

<br>

<img src="images/england/england-2297.jpg" alt=""><br>

Aliona basking in the sun at the Tower of London, with the Tower Bridge in the background.<br>

<br>

<br>

<img src="images/england/england-2300.jpg" alt=""><br>

At certain times, the guards of the Tower march about
ceremoniously.&nbsp; Despite their cartoonish appearance (maybe not as
cartoonish as the Vatican guards), they carry serious weapons... I
believe SA-80 assault rifles.&nbsp; This is why no one makes fun of
their hats.<br>

<br>

<br>

<img src="images/england/england-2301.jpg" alt=""><br>

This warder did not want to pose for this picture.&nbsp; Upon request,
he stopped and barked "Quick!"&nbsp; Meanwhile, Aliona was listening to
the audioguide's gory description of medieval torture that took place
in this castle.<br>

<br>

<br>

<img src="images/england/england-2304.jpg" alt=""><br>

A bird in hand is worth two in the cage... wait, that doesn't make
sense.&nbsp; Well, the bird is really in the cage, so it's a moot point.<br>

<br>

<br>

<img src="images/england/england-2312.jpg" alt=""><br>

We had to take this picture before we were scolded.&nbsp; I'm sure Queen Elizabeth I would be fine with it.<br>

<br>

<br>

<img src="images/england/england-2319.jpg" alt=""><br>

Aliona armed herself well, just in case.<br>

<br>

<br>

<img src="images/england/england-2320.jpg" alt=""><br>

At this moment, we realized the Tower, along with its toilets were
closed and we'd have to pay half a pound to use the ones outside.<br>

<br>

<br>

<img src="images/england/england-2323.jpg" alt=""><br>

We sustained ourselves with a continuous supply of Green &amp; Black
organic 85% dark chocolate, which we're both addicted to.&nbsp; I'm
sure you needed to know that.&nbsp; In case you actually did, try 70%
first.<br>

<br>

<br>

<img src="images/england/england-2333.jpg" alt=""><br>

As we walked along the Thames to Westminster abbey, many fine athletes ran past us, training for the London marathon I'm sure.<br>

<br>

<br>

<img src="images/england/england-2334.jpg" alt=""><br>

A feathery soul zones out.<br>

<br>

<br>

<img src="images/england/england-2339.jpg" alt=""><br>

While I had to admire this gorgeous monument to the brave soldiers who
fought for their country, I had to fight off an inappropriate sense of
jealousy.<br>

<br>

<br>

<img src="images/england/england-2343.jpg" alt=""><br>

And speaking of inappropriate...<br>

<br>

<br>

<img src="images/england/england-2344.jpg" alt=""><br>

Well, we were just having fun.&nbsp; Sorry Brits.<br>

<br>

<br>

<img src="images/england/england-2347.jpg" alt=""><br>

We treat ourselves to an authentically-crafted crepe.<br>

<br>

<br>

<img src="images/england/england-2351.jpg" alt=""><br>

Here we are at Westminster Abbey.&nbsp; You can't really see the abbey
here, but Big Ben is right next to it, and Big Ben is a blatant camera
whore.<br>

<br>

<br>

<img src="images/england/england-2356.jpg" alt=""><br>

Aliona attempts to see what's behind the oldest door in Great Britain.<br>

<br>

<br>

<img src="images/england/england-2357.jpg" alt=""><br>

Back at home (we rented a "holiday apartment"), we slowly acquired a
stash of healthy cheaper food options in our fridge.&nbsp; There are a
lot of foods in Europe that taste much more natural than their American
counterparts.&nbsp; Especially the apple juice, in the carton to the
bottom right.<br>

<br>
<br>
<img src="images/england/england-2371.jpg" alt=""><br>
We made our way to Buckingham Palace.&nbsp; I was going to crash the party, but even I was too short to climb this gate.<br>
<br>

<br>

<img src="images/england/england-2364.jpg" alt=""><br>

Plus, these guards also had SA-80 assault rifles.<br>

<br>

<br>

<img src="images/england/england-2366.jpg" alt=""><br>

Instead, we walked around the much more approachable Queens Garden with more hats to snicker at.<br>

<br>

<br>

<img src="images/england/england-2379.jpg" alt=""><br>
We were bought these marzipan treats from the palace gift shop and were
disappointed they tasted nothing like the fruits they were shaped as.<br>
<br>
<br>
<img src="images/england/england-2378.jpg" alt=""><br>

This tastes nothing like an orange.&nbsp; Why did they bother making it look so realistic??<br>

<br>

<br>

<img src="images/england/england-2385.jpg" alt=""><br>

In my angst, I bit into a real apple.&nbsp; With Aliona around, my backpack was always stocked with apples.<br>

<br>

<br>

<img src="images/england/england-2387.jpg" alt=""><br>

I had to show Harrods to Aliona.. especially the toy department.&nbsp; In her excitement, I was promptly decorated.<br>

<br>

<br>

<img src="images/england/england-2394.jpg" alt=""><br>

Aliona feeds her finger to a little crocodile.<br>

<br>

<br>

<img src="images/england/england-2395.jpg" alt=""><br>

The resident safari took a liking to Aliona.&nbsp; Especially the little rhino on the left.<br>

<br>

<br>

<img src="images/england/england-2400.jpg" alt=""><br>

I told Aliona it was time to move on, and the rhino charged me.<br>

<br>

<br>

<img src="images/england/england-2401.jpg" alt=""><br>

We stuck around for another hour, waiting for this little lamb to finish its nap on Aliona's arm.<br>

<br>

<br>

<img src="images/england/england-2403.jpg" alt=""><br>

Me saluting alongside Captain Lego as I finally escaped.<br>

<br>

<br>

<img src="images/england/england-2404.jpg" alt=""><br>

Staffers were flying around all sorts of toys into customers' heads in
an effort to have less people to deal with.&nbsp; They landed a
helicopter on my head twice and this thing almost sawed my ear off.<br>

<br>

<br>

<img src="images/england/england-2405.jpg" alt=""><br>

Harrods has a frozen yogurt place of their own, "Yoo Moo".&nbsp; They
had a few "yogurt sundaes" on the menu with "Yoo Moo" themed
names.&nbsp; To my good fortune, the "Yoo-Messy-Moo" stuck as my
nickname for the rest of the vacation.<br>

<br>

<br>

<img src="images/england/england-2414.jpg" alt=""><br>

A kitten flew into Aliona's hands, to give her one last smooch before we left the toy section.<br>

<br>

<br>

<img src="images/england/england-2423.jpg" alt=""><br>
Later that night we headed over to see a musical, "We Will Rock You",
themed on Queen songs.&nbsp; We saw American Idiot (Green Day) recently
which was amazing, so we were psyched.<br>
<br>
<br>
<img src="images/england/england-2419.jpg" alt=""><br>

Here was when everyone took a photo of the theater before we were told
not to take photos.&nbsp; I can't say the musical was great.&nbsp; The
plot was a fairly goofy Brave New World clone. (American Idiot had a
solid plot)<br>

<br>

<br>

<img src="images/england/england-2421.jpg" alt=""><br>

However, I still enjoyed the music and the silly dancing.<br>

<br>

<br>

<img src="images/england/england-2424.jpg" alt=""><br>

Another day we attended this free lecture on "The Meaning of Life", a
title admittedly stolen from Monty Python.&nbsp; The speaker was very
articulate and had many slides with sensationalist headlines such as
"Ending it all", so it was entertaining.&nbsp; However, I solidified my
view of philosophy as being a fairly inconclusive exercise and decided
to just appreciate the nuances of the British accent.<br>

<br>

<br>

<img src="images/england/england-2425.jpg" alt=""><br>

For most of the lecture, we were thinking of this nearby good-looking
sushi joint.&nbsp; Many London sushi restaurants have conveyer belts
with food on color-coded plates.&nbsp; When you're done eating, the
color of your empty plates represent prices and, in turn, your bill.<br>

<br>

<br>

<img src="images/england/england-2426.jpg" alt=""><br>

I had a lot of hot chocolate in London.&nbsp; I like hot chocolate a lot, with or without marshmallows.<br>

<br>

<br>

<img src="images/england/england-2431.jpg" alt=""><br>
Our apartment was within a minute's walk of the British Museum.&nbsp; I
had seen the British Museum fairly thoroughly before, and we weren't
really in the mood for ancient history.&nbsp; However, since it was so
close, we forced ourselves to see some of it.&nbsp; This is Aliona
pretending to enjoy the museum.<br>
<br>
<br>
<img src="images/england/england-2427.jpg" alt=""><br>

We walked through like zombies, trying to see some of it.<br>

<br>

<br>

<img src="images/england/england-2432.jpg" alt=""><br>
Aliona likes skeletons, so she enjoyed some of it.<br>
<br>
<br>
<img src="images/england/england-2434.jpg" alt=""><br>

She called this cute.<br>

<br>

<br>

<img src="images/england/england-2437.jpg" alt=""><br>

After a nice curator described the origins of a collection of six artifacts to us, we decided to disengage thought and be goofy.<br>

<br>

<br>

<img src="images/england/england-2442.jpg" alt=""><br>

Aliona and I spent ten minutes trying unsuccessfully to hack into the British Museum's network.<br>

<br>

<br>

<img src="images/england/england-2449.jpg" alt=""><br>

I figured we should see the cool-looking Rosetta Stone before we
left.&nbsp; The idea was, it made it easier to translate Egyptian
hieroglyphics because the same text was written on this stone in three
languages, including hieroglyphics and modern Greek.<br>

<br>

<br>

<img src="images/england/england-2451.jpg" alt=""><br>

The doubledecker buses were equipped with video monitoring
systems.&nbsp; The on-board TVs rotate between 12 cameras around the
bus.&nbsp; When it showed view #7, I took a picture of it showing
me.&nbsp; I proceeded to wait for the next cycle and then take a
picture of the camera.&nbsp; I wanted to see if the flash blinded
everyone.&nbsp; Sadly, it just made the TV white for a couple
milliseconds.<br>

<br>

<br>

<img src="images/england/england-2453.jpg" alt=""><br>

You can more easily see things high above the road when riding on the second floor of a doubledecker bus.<br>

<br>

<br>

<img src="images/england/england-2457.jpg" alt=""><br>

We were trying to get to this family-run "North Sea Fish Restaurant"
which seemed to get rave reviews for its fish and chips.&nbsp; I went
for the jumbo serving, deciding to keep my arteries on their
toes.&nbsp; Aliona also wanted to try a couple of bites of the famed
dish, but no more.<br>

<br>

<br>

<img src="images/england/england-2461.jpg" alt=""><br>

We like playing with our food at the end of the meal.&nbsp; This was Aliona's handywork alone though.&nbsp; She did this.<br>

<br>

<br>

<img src="images/england/england-2463.jpg" alt=""><br>

We made our way out to "The Vibe" to hear some psychedelic rock.<br>

<br>

<br>

<img src="images/england/england-2465.jpg" alt=""><br>

The second band's guitarists performed in front of the stage.&nbsp;
Their distortion pedal was hooked up to trigger a strobe light,
inducing epilepsy in their fans.<br>

<br>

<br>

<img src="images/england/england-2468.jpg" alt=""><br>

The next day, we forced ourselves to wake up early for a "Windsor
Castle, Stonehenge, Oxford" tour.&nbsp; Windsor was a nice town, and
just as interesting as the castle, especially with most of the interior
(the State Apartments) temporarily closed.<br>

<br>

<br>

<img src="images/england/england-2474.jpg" alt=""><br>

We made the most of looking around at things from the outside.&nbsp; There's a structure over there!&nbsp; See?<br>

<br>

<br>

<img src="images/england/england-2483.jpg" alt=""><br>

Aliona takes in the glorious external view.<br>

<br>

<br>

<img src="images/england/england-2489.jpg" alt=""><br>

I'm pretty annoyed that the tour company did not inform us about the closure before the tour.&nbsp; Aliona contemplates revenge.<br>

<br>

<br>

<img src="images/england/england-2492.jpg" alt=""><br>

I get impatient and start blowing things up.&nbsp; That's what Americans are supposed to do, right?<br>

<br>

<br>

<img src="images/england/england-2504.jpg" alt=""><br>

I read a fictional book about Stonehenge, which inspired me to see
Stonehenge.&nbsp; When I confessed to Aliona that I was more looking
forward to Oxford, I was beaten for dragging her along to see a bunch
of ugly rocks.&nbsp; We did both agree they looked cool though.<br>

<br>

<br>

<img src="images/england/england-2522.jpg" alt=""><br>

Also, there were lots of tiny little sheep near Stonehenge to amuse
us.&nbsp; They apparently rent out some of the land near Stonehenge to
help pay for maintenance.<br>

<br>

<br>

<img src="images/england/england-2547.jpg" alt=""><br>

Okay, the sheep weren't really that tiny.&nbsp; Here you can see the
bluish paint on the sheep.&nbsp; They paint the underbellies of male
sheep with different colors of paint, so they can find out who shagged
who.<br>

<br>

<br>

<img src="images/england/england-2554.jpg" alt=""><br>

The weather was surprisingly good and relatively warm throughout most
of our vacation.&nbsp; We passed through a few brief showers during
transit though.<br>

<br>

<br>

<img src="images/england/england-2558.jpg" alt=""><br>

You can't look much more scholarly than Oxford does.<br>

<br>

<br>

<img src="images/england/england-2560.jpg" alt=""><br>

Creepy faces surround the building that hosts Oxford University graduation ceremonies.<br>

<br>

<br>

<img src="images/england/england-2561.jpg" alt=""><br>

In the ground outside the same building are stonecutter marks like
these which directly inspired the scar on Harry Potter's forehead.<br>

<br>

<br>

<img src="images/england/england-2570.jpg" alt=""><br>

This is as close as I'll get to attending Oxford.<br>

<br>

<br>

<img src="images/england/england-2576.jpg" alt=""><br>

Especially after this incident.<br>

<br>

<br>

<img src="images/england/england-2577.jpg" alt=""><br>

Take a picture of this building and you instantly have an engaging
photograph.&nbsp; I have to give myself some credit for the symmetry
though.<br>

<br>

<br>

<img src="images/england/england-2585.jpg" alt=""><br>

Aliona enjoys the peaceful courtyard of one of the many Oxford colleges.<br>

<br>

<br>

<img src="images/england/england-2587.jpg" alt=""><br>

We found a way to give you a quick yet comprehensive view of one of these courtyards.<br>

<br>

<br>

<img src="images/england/england-2589.jpg" alt=""><br>

We stopped for coffee on the way back to the bus.&nbsp; This dude,
probably the boyfriend of the barista, was taking a nap behind the
counter.&nbsp; I asked about him, which resulted in a good laugh.<br>

<br>

<br>

<img src="images/england/england-2598.jpg" alt=""><br>

Not much to do on the bus ride back to London, so I decided to show off my experimental photography skills to Aliona.<br>

<br>

<br>

<img src="images/england/england-2615.jpg" alt=""><br>

This was created by twisting the camera strap and letting it spin while
exposed to passing traffic.&nbsp; Unfortunately, it resulted in my
camera strap breaking.&nbsp; I need a new one.<br>

<br>

<br>

<img src="images/england/england-2633.jpg" alt=""><br>

My experimental photography soon came to an end when I targeted Aliona's face.&nbsp; I think it looks cool though.<br>

<br>

<br>

<img src="images/england/england-2659.jpg" alt=""><br>

Sad puppy on the Tube.<br>

<br>

<br>

<img src="images/england/england-2667.jpg" alt=""><br>

We heard there was an ice sculpture competition at Canary Wharf.&nbsp;
We took a couple hops on the tube and were immersed by an industrial
yet serene watery haven.<br>

<br>

<br>

<img src="images/england/england-2681.jpg" alt=""><br>
Right off the bat, I'll show you the ice sculpture from Portugal that ended up winning.<br>
<br>
<br>
<img src="images/england/england-2679.jpg" alt=""><br>

The French really knew how to warm up a block of ice with the curves of a woman's naked backside.<br>

<br>

<br>

<img src="images/england/england-2683.jpg" alt=""><br>

Near the ice sculpture competition was another ice-skating rink.&nbsp;
We did go to this one, and we went ice skating for the first
time.&nbsp; Here's Aliona avoiding the girl sliding along with her
penguin, designed to help kids maintain balance.<br>

<br>

<br>

<img src="images/england/england-2684.jpg" alt=""><br>

Look ma, no hands!&nbsp; Ma would actually be the first one to say I
skated before, and she said exactly that.&nbsp; However, it was when I
was very small and I did not actually succeed in "skating" once.&nbsp;
When I wasn't clutching the rails, I flopped over instantly.&nbsp;
Since then I've done rollerblading and skiing, so I'm sure that helped,
and over the course of 40 minutes or so, I did not fall, despite many
less fortunate adults and children who were bumping into me.<br>

<br>

<br>

<img src="images/england/england-2699.jpg" alt=""><br>

We revisited the ice sculptures afterward to see them lit in the dark.<br>

<br>

<br>

<img src="images/england/england-2701.jpg" alt=""><br>

My favorite was Africa's lion.<br>

<br>

<br>

<img src="images/england/england-2706.jpg" alt=""><br>

That night we had reservations for a sushi place in London with rave
reviews.&nbsp; We got there 20 minutes early and they wouldn't seat us,
so we were forced to stare at this creative picture for the whole time.<br>

<br>

<br>

<img src="images/england/england-2707.jpg" alt=""><br>

This time it was me who played with my food.&nbsp; Here's our leftover
wasabi in the form of a smiley face.&nbsp; Aliona added the moustache
and hairy/grassy eyebrows.<br>

<br>

<br>

<img src="images/england/england-2712.jpg" alt=""><br>

Along the Thames, I set a loose brick upon the arm of a bench.&nbsp; I
set the camera on the brick and was able to take a decent photo at
night.<br>

<br>

<br>

<img src="images/england/england-2715.jpg" alt=""><br>

In Covent Garden, this man drew a crowd of drunks with good songs such
as Police's Every Breath You Take and Billy Joel's Piano Man.<br>

<br>

<br>

<img src="images/england/england-2718.jpg" alt=""><br>

Aliona imitates a doll with oversized-eyes.<br>

<br>

<br>

<img src="images/england/england-2727.jpg" alt=""><br>

We made our way to the British Library.<br>

<br>

<br>

<img src="images/england/england-2731.jpg" alt=""><br>

They had an exhibit on "English", including how it evolved, and what it
is like today, with different accents and regional vocabularies.&nbsp;
Here I found an old-fashion printing press they let me play with.<br>

<br>

<br>

<img src="images/england/england-2732.jpg" alt=""><br>

One thing we were saddened to have learned was that the although the
library was certainly open on Sundays, the book collections are
closed.&nbsp; The closest we got to books were taking highly zoomed in
pictures of them through glass.<br>

<br>

<br>

<img src="images/england/england-2738.jpg" alt=""><br>

The British Museum was designed with an open, balcony-encircled lobby area.<br>

<br>

<br>

<img src="images/england/england-2741.jpg" alt=""><br>
I took this picture sideways to disorient you.<br>

<br>

<br>

<img src="images/england/england-2749.jpg" alt=""><br>

This table in one of the lobby's reading areas had these "seats".<br>

<br>

<br>

<img src="images/england/england-2751.jpg" alt=""><br>

Here we demonstrate their usage.&nbsp; They were quite comfortable to
lay back and read in, and I think it would help me stay a bit more
alert too.<br>

<br>

<br>

<img src="images/england/england-2763.jpg" alt=""><br>

Here we played with toys in a souvenir shop.&nbsp; These skeletons
seemed made for the little plastic horses we put them on.&nbsp; In
retrospect, they probably were.&nbsp; The skeletons are having a good
time despite a lack of flesh.<br>

<br>

<br>

<img src="images/england/england-2769.jpg" alt=""><br>

We eat ramen at a Wagamama with a nice view of the Tower of London in
the background, as you can see here.&nbsp; Okay, I know you can't,
because it's dark.&nbsp; Please refer to prior pictures to see the
Tower of London.<br>

At the Tower of London, on our last night in London, we started a "Jack
the Ripper" tour.&nbsp; This is the world's foremost expert on Jack the
Ripper, so Aliona made sure we got his time slot.&nbsp; I told him
Aliona was a student, so he informed me the student price was 200
pounds.&nbsp; Kidding of course.&nbsp; I later blasted Jack the Ripoff
with my flash, which he immediately recognized as my revenge.<br>

It was all in good fun though, and here we posed for a picture.&nbsp;
We bought his book and he signed it, but I still can't decipher what he
wrote to us in it.<br>

In the Jack the Ripper-famed Ten Bells pub, Ten Bells, the killer's
victims and possibly the killer himself were reported to have stopped
in.&nbsp; The stairwell to the restroom is decorated with newspaper
reports on the murders.&nbsp; As Aliona was finished with the toilet
and walked up the stairs, I got in character.<br>

All along there was a really nice cocktail bar right around the corner
from our apartment.&nbsp; At least we discovered it on the last
night.&nbsp; Here the bartender made us a pair of her finest
spiced-mango mojitos.<br>

As we prepared for our flight back across the pond, we watched both CNN and BBC on the tiny TV they gave us.<br>

At Heathrow's duty free shops, something quite stunning are the warnings required on every box of cigarettes.<br>

Not just "Smoking kills", but also other depressing messages.<br>

Smoking is bad for you though.&nbsp; I'll be upset if you die from smoking.<br>

Here we see the plane slated to fly us back to New York.&nbsp; If you
look closely, you can see that yes, it does have a second wing.<br>
