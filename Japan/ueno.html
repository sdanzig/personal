made a mad rush at 3:30pm or so, to get to the Ueno zoo, in Ueno park,
before it stopped admitting people at 4pm. &nbsp;I made a couple wrong
turns, but I figured I could barely make it in, and see the giant panda
they're supposed to have there. &nbsp;Well, I made it to the zoo in
time, but not the entrance. &nbsp;I heard the boars happily snorting
behind the fence, and saw some glimpses of flamingos. &nbsp;Alas, I
could not get in. &nbsp;Later I found out the panda died years ago
anyway, so I guess this temple was good enough.<br><br><br><img src="images/tokyo/ueno/tokyo_187.jpg" alt=""><br>Here's a shrine surrounded by lots of stone lanterns.<br><br><br><img src="images/tokyo/ueno/tokyo_186.jpg" alt=""><br>Upon
further investigation, I read this. &nbsp;The Japanese have their heart
in the right place. &nbsp;I read some literature that says America may
have forced Japan into the war, and I'm sure some believe that.
&nbsp;However, this plaque only talks about what's important.
&nbsp;A-bombs are bad, and we should remember that.<br><br><br><img src="images/tokyo/ueno/tokyo_188.jpg" alt=""><br>Here's a colorful little amusement park. &nbsp;I bought an ice cream cone here.<br><br><br><img src="images/tokyo/ueno/tokyo_192.jpg" alt=""><br>This fountain seemed more imperial than the fountains at the Imperial Palace.<br><br><br><img src="images/tokyo/ueno/tokyo_194.jpg" alt=""><br>I guess I would have liked to have more time to see Ueno Park during the day. &nbsp;You can see it's worth exploring.<br><br><br><img src="images/tokyo/ueno/tokyo_191.jpg" alt=""><br>So
the transition to these guys might seem sudden, but there's an
explanation. &nbsp;I ended up wandering into the National Museum there,
and I was only allowed to take pictures of some of the exhibits.<br><br><br><img src="images/tokyo/ueno/tokyo_190.jpg" alt=""><br>As long as there was no "Photos not allowed" signs, I was snapping pictures. &nbsp;Don't ask me to explain this one.<br><br><br><img src="images/tokyo/ueno/tokyo_195.jpg" alt=""><br>Statues gaze peacefully into oblivion, adorned with skillfully carved draped clothing.<br><br><br><img src="images/tokyo/ueno/tokyo_197.jpg" alt=""><br>I
like the reflective moon in this one. &nbsp;Very good manipulation of
the medium. &nbsp;It looks to me like the moon is a circle of polished
stone, but maybe it was painted.<br><br><br><img src="images/tokyo/ueno/tokyo_196.jpg" alt=""><br>Brass monkeys.<br><br><br><img src="images/tokyo/ueno/tokyo_193.jpg" alt=""><br>Here's
a katana. &nbsp;There was lots of information, mostly in Japanese,
about the history of these swords. &nbsp;I liked the dragon decoration along the middle of this blade.<br><br><br><img src="images/tokyo/ueno/tokyo_189.jpg" alt=""><br>Here's some of that information, and I was allowed to take a picture. &nbsp;Enjoy!<br><br><br><img src="images/tokyo/ueno/tokyo_176.jpg" alt=""><br>A sword that looks this good after over a thousand years. &nbsp;Kind of surreal.<br><br><br><img src="images/tokyo/ueno/tokyo_199.jpg" alt=""><br>So
we left the museum and headed over to a restaurant. &nbsp;We walked
past these dancers, all Japanese. &nbsp;They were dancing to American
1950's music. &nbsp;It was awesome and refreshing at the same time.
&nbsp;I haven't seen this style of dancing since my last trip to Johnny
Rocket's.<br><br><br><img src="images/tokyo/ueno/tokyo_198.jpg" alt=""><br>Here's a clearer photo of the dancers, after they calmed down a bit.<br><br><br><img src="images/tokyo/ueno/tokyo_201.jpg" alt=""><br>When
I said "we" on this page, I did not mean me and my friends from New
Jersey. &nbsp;I meant me and a woman I met in Ueno, formerly pictured here. &nbsp;I met her in
the museum and we decided to eat dinner together at a Korean
restaurant. &nbsp;I later learned that in Japanese culture, that hand
on her shoulder was a bit presumptuous. &nbsp;Perhaps that's why I had to adjust the picture accordingly.<br><br><br><img src="images/tokyo/ueno/tokyo_200.jpg" alt=""><br>We
enjoyed a lot of tasty food that we threw on this little grill, piece
by piece, and pulled off with chopsticks. &nbsp;I forget what type of
wine we had, but it was good.<br><br><br><br><br><a href="tokyo.html">Back</a><br></div></body></html>
