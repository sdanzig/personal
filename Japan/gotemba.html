the Mount Fuji fiasco/success, I found my friends sleeping away back in
our hotel at the Gotemba Kogen Resort. &nbsp;Sometimes it's also called
the Gotemba Kogen Brewery, named after a brewery in a restaurant at the
resort. &nbsp;I figured it was a nice place to unwind after a very
traumatizing mountain climb.<br><br><br><img src="images/fuji/gotemba_resort/fuji_2.jpg" alt=""><br>Here's Paul and Miller at the resort.<br><br><br><img src="images/fuji/gotemba_resort/fuji_6.jpg" alt=""><br>The
resort didn't really feel like your average resort. &nbsp;It was a bit
rustic for that. &nbsp;It was pretty big and spread out, with some
outdoor dining, a park, tennis courts, a beach volleyball court, a
soccer field, two restaurants, one of which included a brewery, a gift
shop, and other things.<br><br><br><img src="images/fuji/gotemba_resort/fuji_5.jpg" alt=""><br>Those other things included these cool-looking bungalows which we didn't stay in.<br><br><br><img src="images/fuji/gotemba_resort/fuji_49.jpg" alt=""><br>Most sculptures at the resort were tacky and draped with Christmas lights. &nbsp;I did like this one though.<br><br><br><br><br><a href="fuji.html">Back</a><br></div></body></html>
