trying to find the aikido dojo, I found a building that looked like it
might be a dojo. &nbsp;I didn't see the building with the big "AIKIDO"
sign, so I ended up peeking in the windows of this place. &nbsp;It
looked like a restaurant, so I was going to keep searching.<br><br><br><img src="images/nagoya/restaurant/nagoya_3.jpg" alt=""><br>This
lady came out of the shop and asked me what I was looking for.
&nbsp;She didn't understand too much, but she understood "aikido" and
pointed at the big "AIKIDO" sign looming over us. &nbsp;I thanked her,
then asked if I could eat. &nbsp;She prepared lots of food for me.
&nbsp;I especially liked the udon noodles. &nbsp;She was watching a
weird TV show showing a detective putting herself in the shoes of the
murder, imagining herself killing people like he did. &nbsp;It was
fairly gory, and I asked her if she liked that show. &nbsp;It was then
that I understood her English was really not that bad. &nbsp;She
explained to me how she liked the combination of drama and romance in
the TV show, then we proceeded to talk about Japanese baseball and I
showed her the video I recorded from the baseball game in Chiba.
&nbsp;She let me know she was a Hanshin Tigers fan, and they had a
better fanbase than my Chiba Lotte Marines. &nbsp;Hmph.<br><br><br><img src="images/nagoya/restaurant/nagoya_2.jpg" alt=""><br>Me and my udon noodles!<br><br><br><img src="images/nagoya/restaurant/nagoya_4.jpg" alt=""><br>She
liked my company a lot, and it was a very sad moment when I had to be
on my way to Nagoya Castle. &nbsp;I miss her and her udon noodles.<br><br><br><br><br><a href="nagoya.html">Back</a><br></div></body></html>
