was in central Tokyo, desperately trying to find a "kite museum" that I
thought would be pretty fun to see. &nbsp;Apparently the kite museum
closed down. &nbsp;Instead, I walked by this massive street cleaning
operation. &nbsp;Who are these people? &nbsp;Tokyo is clean, but this
would be just silly. &nbsp;They didn't look like inmates.<br><br><br><img src="images/tokyo/cleaning_festival/tokyo_152.jpg" alt=""><br>Citizens of Tokyo were scrubbing every inch of a sectioned off area of a street.<br><br><br><img src="images/tokyo/cleaning_festival/tokyo_151.jpg" alt=""><br>I
asked at a nearby coffee shop (Starbucks of course) what was going on.
&nbsp;They told me it was an annual cleaning festival. &nbsp;No real
reason behind it, and it only took place at this location.
&nbsp;Something tells me it's fairly prestigious to work at this
super-clean section of Tokyo. &nbsp;Anyway, there were plenty of kids
there. &nbsp;It looked like they were on school field trips or
something. &nbsp;There were a bunch of police officers there,
admittedly on fairly light duty. &nbsp;People took pictures of their
kids and neighbors scrubbing the soapy scrub.<br><br><br><img src="images/tokyo/cleaning_festival/tokyo_154.jpg" alt=""><br>There was also an organized operation to provide lunches to the cleaners, and probably the organizers as well.<br><br><br><img src="images/tokyo/cleaning_festival/tokyo_155.jpg" alt=""><br>A line of fire trucks sat nearby, providing water as necessary.<br><br><br><br><a href="tokyo.html">Back</a><br></div></body></html>
