we are on the train heading to the Mt. Fuji area. &nbsp;This experience
reminded me of when I was approaching Mt. Vesuvius by train. &nbsp;I
was playing "find the mountain". &nbsp;Are any of these mountains Mt.
Fuji? &nbsp;How would I know! &nbsp;However, these were the first
mountains I saw, and I didn't get a very good shot of Mt. Fuji from the
distance, so this will have to suffice.<br><br><br><img src="images/fuji/fuji_47.jpg" alt=""><img src="images/fuji/fuji_48.jpg" alt=""><br>These
were two Shinkansen trains I saw at Gotemba station. &nbsp;The Japan
railway system has different classes of trains. &nbsp;The Shinkansens
are the long distance trains that go regularly at speeds around 186
miles per hour.<br><br><br><a href="mountain.html">The mountain</a><br><br><a href="gotemba.html">Gotemba Kogen Resort</a><br><br><br><br><br><a href="index.html">Back</a><br></div></body></html>
