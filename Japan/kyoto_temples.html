main plan in Kyoto was to go to a fancy restaurant, and also do random
sightseeing. &nbsp;Most of the sightseeing in Kyoto was temples.
&nbsp;Kyoto is rich with cultural heritage. &nbsp;It was the capital of
Japan. &nbsp;Too bad most of the temples burned down multiple times.
&nbsp;Multiple times you wonder? &nbsp;Japan likes to build from
scratch. &nbsp;When you buy a new home, they destroy the home, then you
buy the land and build the house. &nbsp;Unfortunately, they destroy and
rebuild temples as well. &nbsp;Maybe it helps keep unemployment down.
&nbsp;Who knows. &nbsp;We were in agreement that reading that a "400
year old temple" had been rebuilt 250, 150, and 50 years ago did take
away a bit of its mystique. &nbsp;Anyway, this picture is from a
Japanese garden we visited, adjacent to a temple. &nbsp;Everything was
beautifully designed, but a grumpy French tourist still complained
about the 5 dollar admission fee and stormed off. &nbsp;We proceeded to
have a discussion amongst ourselves on who the world's worst tourists
are. &nbsp;According to some study quoted, the French were, but #2 was
the Americans. &nbsp;I don't like being thought of as a bad tourist!<br><br><br><img src="images/kyoto/temples/kyoto_64.jpg" alt=""><br>The walls in Kyoto oozed with Japanese tradition.<br><br><br><img src="images/kyoto/temples/kyoto_74.jpg" alt=""><br>Kyoto has no lack of chlorophyll.<br><br><br><img src="images/kyoto/temples/kyoto_73.jpg" alt=""><br>Fish in Kyoto were very ravenous. &nbsp;I feared the one in the middle might jump out and chomp on my nose.<br><br><br><img src="images/kyoto/temples/kyoto_72.jpg" alt=""><br>Me abusing one of these fish with my photography.<br><br><br><img src="images/kyoto/temples/kyoto_70.jpg" alt=""><br>You can see Kyoto Tower in the distance. &nbsp;Lily pads float over the pond during this peaceful summer day.<br><br><br><img src="images/kyoto/temples/kyoto_68.jpg" alt=""><br>Rippling
water, gracefully manicured trees and a small waterfall give a tea
house an enchanting backdrop. &nbsp;Hmm... maybe I should go into real
estate sales.<br><br><br><img src="images/kyoto/temples/kyoto_67.jpg" alt=""><br>This picture reminds me of a Claude Monet painting. &nbsp;You can probably figure out which.<br><br><br><img src="images/kyoto/temples/kyoto_66.jpg" alt=""><br>Footbridges
were always positioned with the surrounding scenery in mind.
&nbsp;They'd be beautiful to see from a distance, and those on the
footbridge would be treated to a wonderful view as well.
&nbsp;Sometimes the footbridge on its own is impressive.<br><br><br><img src="images/kyoto/temples/kyoto_26.JPG" alt=""><br>A busy uphill street in Kyoto. &nbsp;Good for the calves.<br><br><br><img src="images/kyoto/temples/kyoto_40.JPG" alt=""><br>This
simple Shinto shrine with the single candy cane rope caught my
attention. &nbsp;The idea is, you pull the rope and you pray for
something while the bell rings.<br><br><br><img src="images/kyoto/temples/kyoto_38.JPG" alt=""><br>These temples and shrines we visited were both Buddhist and Shinto. &nbsp;They coexist very well in Japan. <br><br><br><img src="images/kyoto/temples/kyoto_28.JPG" alt=""><br>Hungry stone beasts stare at you. &nbsp;They can't stop you though, because they're statues.<br><br><br><img src="images/kyoto/temples/kyoto_34.JPG" alt=""><br>We
passed by very intricate shrines&nbsp;in Kyoto. &nbsp;This actually
reminds me of another shrine I saw in Tokyo. &nbsp;Different color
though.<br><br><br><img src="images/kyoto/temples/kyoto_33.JPG" alt=""><br>A large temple with another rope and bell.<br><br><br><img src="images/kyoto/temples/kyoto_32.JPG" alt=""><br>This shrine reminds me of a mexican with a sombrero.<br><br><br><img src="images/kyoto/temples/kyoto_31.JPG" alt=""><br>Some buildings looked very attractive and fit in very well, but we had no idea what they were for.<br><br><br><img src="images/kyoto/temples/kyoto_24.JPG" alt=""><br>Those
white lamps must look very impressive when they're lit at night.
&nbsp;During the day though, they look like rows of shark teeth.<br><br><br><img src="images/kyoto/temples/kyoto_23.JPG" alt=""><br>This
roof demonstrates the two main roof shapes I've been seeing.
&nbsp;There was the triangular shape in the back, with the tapered
corners. &nbsp;There was also the bell-shaped arch in the front.<br><br><br><img src="images/kyoto/temples/kyoto_22.JPG" alt=""><br>This
shrine has multiple ropes. &nbsp;You can ring whichever bell you're
willing to wait for. &nbsp;This is our first few of Chiemi, our friend
Jay's girlfriend. &nbsp;Jay was stationed out in Okinawa for 4 years,
and that's when he met her. &nbsp;Here she demonstrates praying at the
shrine.<br><br><br><img src="images/kyoto/temples/kyoto_21.JPG" alt=""><br>Another bright orange archway, this one being across a busy street.<br><br><br><img src="images/kyoto/temples/kyoto_20.JPG" alt=""><br>I
wouldn't have minded hitting my head on these paper lanterns. &nbsp;I
probably hit my head, much more painfully, once for each of these
lanterns. &nbsp;There, I just counted them. &nbsp;It's not far off.<br>&nbsp;<br><br><img src="images/kyoto/temples/kyoto_19.JPG" alt=""><br>We
weren't quite ready to cook anything, but I'm sure she only would have
accepted cash anyway. &nbsp;You can only carry around so much at once.<br><br><br><img src="images/kyoto/temples/kyoto_25.JPG" alt=""><br>This
was an elaborate entrance to even more temples. &nbsp;It was also something
to take your mind off all those stairs. &nbsp;This was important, because I
was still having traumatic Mt. Fuji flashbacks at this time.<br><br><br><img src="images/kyoto/temples/kyoto_37.JPG" alt=""><br>Me in the archway!<br><br><br><img src="images/kyoto/temples/kyoto_36.JPG" alt=""><br>Some of the statues had very intimidating expressions.<br><br><br><img src="images/kyoto/temples/kyoto_35.JPG" alt=""><br>Here's another shot with Kyoto Tower in the distance. &nbsp;It's a fairly short tower, but it has a very distinctive shape.<br><br><br><img src="images/kyoto/temples/kyoto_41.JPG" alt=""><br>Here
was a big post people were trying to lift up. &nbsp;I'm not sure why.
&nbsp;I just know it was heavy. &nbsp;These people couldn't lift it,
but Jay and Miller teamed up and hoisted the thing up briefly together.
&nbsp;Everyone in the vicinity watched in amazement.<br><br><br><img src="images/kyoto/temples/kyoto_45.JPG" alt=""><br>The blue sky and orange temple look wonderful together they are the New York Mets colors!<br><br><br><img src="images/kyoto/temples/kyoto_39.JPG" alt=""><br>An even father shot of Kyoto Tower, with a temple looming over the forest.<br><br><br><img src="images/kyoto/temples/kyoto_29.JPG" alt=""><br>Me,
Miller, Paul, and Jay. &nbsp;I think out of all my pictures, Miller
looks best in this one. &nbsp;He's also wearing a shirt showing a goth
version of the Powerpuff Girls, a popular cartoon show where three
little girls foil the evil plans of Mojo-jojo, an equally evil monkey
with a glass dome over his brain, so you can see it.<br><br><br><img src="images/kyoto/temples/kyoto_42.JPG" alt=""><br>Jay
and his girlfriend Chiemi look like a nice couple. &nbsp;Here they pose
for someone else, and I take a picture for my own diabolical scheme
(posting it here) anyway.<br><br><br><img src="images/kyoto/temples/kyoto_46.JPG" alt=""><br>Every
so often we pass a Shinto handwashing shrine. &nbsp;This water was
falling from the mountains high above and, at the time, looked very
refreshing. &nbsp;They were selling bottles you could store the icy
water in for later consumption. &nbsp;Shinto handwashing shrines were very common.<br><br><br><img src="images/kyoto/temples/kyoto_18.JPG" alt=""><br>More lilypads over glassy water.<br><br><br><img src="images/kyoto/temples/kyoto_17.JPG" alt=""><br>Do not try to walk on these lily pads. &nbsp;Tiny creatures only.<br><br><br><img src="images/kyoto/temples/kyoto_15.JPG" alt=""><br>In
one Buddhist temple, we see the famous Karesansui garden in the
Ry&#333;an-ji Temple. &nbsp;I'm not sure why it's famous, but it definitely
looks like a traditional rock garden to me. &nbsp;There's actually an
evolution of rock gardens. &nbsp;They started out very simple, such as
this one. &nbsp;The more elaborate rock gardens can actually have trees
and flowers. &nbsp;I learned this at the Morikami Japanese Garden in
Miami. &nbsp;They actually have examples of three different stages of
rock gardens. &nbsp;In respect to the artform and tradition,&nbsp;I
spent some meditative moments staring at the rocks here. &nbsp;There
are many ideas suggested as to what these rocks mean. &nbsp;My
meditation let me draw my own ideas, which I promptly forgot.<br><br><br><img src="images/kyoto/temples/kyoto_14.JPG" alt=""><br>Not every lawn needs plush grass. &nbsp;Sometimes moss looks better.<br><br><br><img src="images/kyoto/temples/kyoto_13.JPG" alt=""><br>A small shrine on a small island in a small pond.<br><br><br><img src="images/kyoto/temples/kyoto_12.jpg" alt=""><br>Very
traditional Japanese architecture. &nbsp;I wonder how long a building
like this lasts, and what sort of maintenance it requires.<br><br><br><img src="images/kyoto/temples/kyoto_11.JPG" alt=""><br>You learn to appreciate the beauty of these shrines very quickly. &nbsp;Especially when they provide shade from the hot sun.<br><br><br><img src="images/kyoto/temples/kyoto_10.JPG" alt=""><br>If you have found this statue hidden in the foliage, then perhaps you have found inner peace.<br><br><br><img src="images/kyoto/temples/kyoto_9.JPG" alt=""><br>Pink flora decorates lily pads which decorates the pond which decorates my picture.<br><br><br><img src="images/kyoto/temples/kyoto_8.JPG" alt=""><br>Another simple rock garden.<br><br><br><img src="images/kyoto/temples/kyoto_7.JPG" alt=""><br>There
were plenty of places to toss your yen at. &nbsp;It was fun to try to
get it in the bowl. &nbsp;I think if you do get it in the bowl, your
wish comes true. &nbsp;Chiemi was pretty good at this. &nbsp;I tried
once and was happy when my coin fell in the bowl too.<br><br><br><img src="images/kyoto/temples/kyoto_4.JPG" alt=""><br>I
have trouble telling sometimes if it's a well, or a bell. &nbsp;I think
I see a bell and rope in there though. &nbsp;Definitely a bell.<br><br><br><img src="images/kyoto/temples/kyoto_3.JPG" alt=""><br>Behold the temple of the golden chicken!<br><br><br><img src="images/kyoto/temples/kyoto_2.JPG" alt=""><br>Here's a close-up of the solid-gold poultry.<br><br><br><img src="images/kyoto/temples/kyoto_1.JPG" alt=""><br>This
was the humblest shrine of them all. &nbsp;I wonder if that red thing
at the top lights up when you score a goal like in hockey.<br><br><br><img src="images/kyoto/temples/kyoto_76.jpg" alt=""><br>A small sprinkler sits in front of a massive two-layer entrance to something.<br><br><br><img src="images/kyoto/temples/kyoto_75.jpg" alt=""><br>This is another handwashing station. &nbsp;I made sure to wash my hands here because I believe in the power of dragon-drool.<br><br><br><img src="images/kyoto/temples/kyoto_71.jpg" alt=""><br>Here's another bird hiding from people on his scenic little retreat.<br><br><br><img src="images/kyoto/temples/kyoto_16.JPG" alt=""><br>We saw buildings with funky designs like this one on the bus-ride to the fancy restaurant we were going to next.<br><br><br><br><br><a href="kyoto.html">Back</a><br></div></body></html>
