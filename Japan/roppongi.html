stopped at Roppongi because I heard they had a tower with a better view
than Tokyo Tower (shorter, but you can see Tokyo Tower from it), and
they have an aquarium up there too. &nbsp;Sounded interesting. &nbsp;At
the Roppongi subway stop, I saw something that caught my attention.
&nbsp;They have standing areas for women only. &nbsp;Not women with
babies or pregnant women. &nbsp;Just women in general.<br><br><br><img src="images/tokyo/roppongi/tokyo_157.jpg" alt=""><br>I
quickly learned the Roppongi Hills is a posh/trendy little shopping
area in Tokyo. &nbsp;Here's a big ol' advertisement at the base of the
Roppongi Tower.<br><br><br><img src="images/tokyo/roppongi/tokyo_156.jpg" alt=""><br>Lots of flowers and a big spider sculpture decorated the courtyard.<br><br><br><img src="images/tokyo/roppongi/tokyo_160.jpg" alt=""><br>I
got in the tower and the start of the aquarium was also the observation
area, way high up at the top of the tower. &nbsp;Here's a waterfall
flowing over fishtanks of tiny fish that look like Nemo.<br><br><br><img src="images/tokyo/roppongi/tokyo_159.jpg" alt=""><br>I zoomed in again to take pictures of tiny sea creatures like this one.<br><br><br><img src="images/tokyo/roppongi/tokyo_165.jpg" alt=""><br>Here's a view of Tokyo from Roppongi Tower. &nbsp;There it is, Tokyo Tower, right in the middle. &nbsp;It is pretty awesome.<br><br><br><img src="images/tokyo/roppongi/tokyo_166.jpg" alt=""><br>Here's a zoomed-in shot of the tower from... the tower.<br><br><br><img src="images/tokyo/roppongi/tokyo_162.jpg" alt=""><br>A seahorse! &nbsp;You can see the seemingly-glowing seahorse sniffing around with its blue-tinted snout.<br><br><br><img src="images/tokyo/roppongi/tokyo_161.jpg" alt="">&nbsp;<br>A bright red shrimp that goes well with tartar sauce.<br><br><br><img src="images/tokyo/roppongi/tokyo_164.jpg" alt=""><br>Pretty iridescent colors.<br><br><br><img src="images/tokyo/roppongi/tokyo_163.jpg" alt=""><br>This is an interesting way to display fish. &nbsp;They look like they're swimming in front of folded paper.<br><br><br><img src="images/tokyo/roppongi/tokyo_170.jpg" alt=""><br>The
aquarium was very impressively designed, but the fish themselves
weren't that impressive, and certainly not very big. &nbsp;I did like
this crystal curtain though.<br><br><br><img src="images/tokyo/roppongi/tokyo_169.jpg" alt=""><br>Here's a &nbsp;fish that has fun in the sand.<br><br><br><img src="images/tokyo/roppongi/tokyo_168.jpg" alt=""><br>This
room was fairly hypnotic. &nbsp;It was surrounded by mirrors, and had
some of these big glass orbs filled with fish. &nbsp; The mirrors made
the room seem larger, and projected the illusion of more orbs.<br><br><br><img src="images/tokyo/roppongi/tokyo_167.jpg" alt=""><br>Staring
into the crystal ball, you can see lots of trapped fish. &nbsp;If you
ask, perhaps they can swim up and tell you your fortune.<br><br><br><br><br><a href="tokyo.html">Back</a><br></div></body></html>
