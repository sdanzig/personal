<body><div style="text-align: center;"><big><big>Tokyo Tower<br></big></big><br><br><br><img src="images/tokyo/tokyo_tower/tokyo_14.JPG" alt=""><br>Here's our first&nbsp;view of Tokyo Tower. &nbsp;Sure enough, there's a Starbucks.<br><br><br><img src="images/tokyo/tokyo_tower/tokyo_24.JPG" alt=""><br>On the way in, we saw a temple right near the base of Tokyo Tower. &nbsp;You can see the tower poking out in the background.<br><br><br><img src="images/tokyo/tokyo_tower/tokyo_22.JPG" alt=""><br>Tokyo
Tower is 332.6 meters tall. &nbsp;The big square platform in the center
is the 150 meter observation deck, and you can go higher up to the
circular 250 meter platform at the base of the needle.<br><br><br><img src="images/tokyo/tokyo_tower/tokyo_62.JPG" alt=""><br>This is one of many views of Tokyo from the tower. &nbsp;Lots of skyscrapers. &nbsp;All fairly neutral colors. &nbsp;How drab.<br><br><br><img src="images/tokyo/tokyo_tower/tokyo_61.JPG" alt=""><br>To spruce up the landscape, I took another picture with some vegetation.<br><br><br><img src="images/tokyo/tokyo_tower/tokyo_42.JPG" alt=""><br>Note
the mist in the distance. &nbsp;It was actually fairly cloudy.
&nbsp;The mist on this side of Tokyo Tower was fairly light, but it
looked like dusk on the other side.<br><br><br><img src="images/tokyo/tokyo_tower/tokyo_41.JPG" alt=""><br>Some
big highways in Tokyo. &nbsp;We didn't drive at all in Japan.
&nbsp;People stay to the left instead of the right. &nbsp;It'd be
really stupid for me to try to remember that.<br><br><br><img src="images/tokyo/tokyo_tower/tokyo_38.JPG" alt=""><br>Paul and a little Japanese boy immersed in the urban landscape.<br><br><br><img src="images/tokyo/tokyo_tower/tokyo_37.JPG" alt=""><br>There
were transparent panels in the floor that you can stand on and see
through, straight down, to the street. &nbsp;Fortunately they were sturdy.<br><br><br><img src="images/tokyo/tokyo_tower/tokyo_34.JPG" alt=""><br>Paul making a goofy face on the way up the tower from the lower observation deck to the higher ones..<br><br><br><img src="images/tokyo/tokyo_tower/tokyo_33.JPG" alt=""><br>The buildings in the distance almost look like headstones.<br><br><br><img src="images/tokyo/tokyo_tower/tokyo_30.JPG" alt=""><br>A traffic circle around a grassy field. &nbsp;Water in the distance.<br><br><br><img src="images/tokyo/tokyo_tower/tokyo_29.JPG" alt=""><br>A spattering of temples amongst the urban landscape.<br><br><br><img src="images/tokyo/tokyo_tower/tokyo_27a.jpg" alt=""><br>One
thing I notice about reflective surfaces on buildings. &nbsp;By definition,
they fit in with their surroundings, at least by color. &nbsp;I was actually able to identify many of these buildings...<br><br><br><img src="images/tokyo/tokyo_tower/tokyo_28.JPG" alt=""><br>...using the building identification computer panel provided.<br><br><br><img src="images/tokyo/tokyo_tower/tokyo_26.JPG" alt=""><br>A temple with a funky roof, and a soccer field, amongst lots more office buildings.<br><br><br><img src="images/tokyo/tokyo_tower/tokyo_56.JPG" alt=""><br>A better look at the temple. &nbsp;It looks like there are two rings at the tip of the roof.<br><br><br><img src="images/tokyo/tokyo_tower/tokyo_53.JPG" alt=""><br>We
had fun watching the soccer game from 250 meters up. &nbsp;I'm sure
some of them were posing for this picture, but I can't tell.<br><br><br><img src="images/tokyo/tokyo_tower/tokyo_25.JPG" alt=""><br>Tokyo as dusk approaches. &nbsp;Or at least the dark clouds.<br><br><br><img src="images/tokyo/tokyo_tower/tokyo_59.JPG" alt=""><br>Here's more proof I was actually in Tokyo.<br><br><br><img src="images/tokyo/tokyo_tower/tokyo_54.JPG" alt=""><br>Paul was there too. &nbsp;It was tougher than you think to get these pictures to come out as well as they did.<br><br><br><img src="images/tokyo/tokyo_tower/tokyo_47.JPG" alt=""><br>The
clouds made Tokyo look darker and darker, as if it was already
nighttime. &nbsp;Buildings and cars started to flip on their lights.
&nbsp;We waited for an amazing view of the sunset from Tokyo Tower.
&nbsp;Because
of the clouds, the this is the best we saw. &nbsp;A murky purple.&nbsp;
I was still happy.<br><br><br><img src="images/tokyo/tokyo_tower/tokyo_50.JPG" alt=""><br>Eventually night actually fell. &nbsp;<br><br><br><img src="images/tokyo/tokyo_tower/tokyo_46.JPG" alt=""><br>While friends and I were joyriding around Tokyo, lots of people there were no doubt working late hours.<br><br><br><img src="images/tokyo/tokyo_tower/tokyo_44.JPG" alt=""><br>This is a cool night shot of that same distinctively shaped building you've seen in my other pictures.<br><br><br><img src="images/tokyo/tokyo_tower/tokyo_66.JPG" alt=""><br>A view of Tokyo Tower at night, as we were leaving.<br><br><br><img src="images/tokyo/tokyo_tower/tokyo_65.JPG" alt=""><br>On
the way out we went back to that temple area. &nbsp;There was a
festival going on! &nbsp;They had buffet tables and music.
&nbsp;Apparently summer festivals are very common around Japan.<br><br><br><img src="images/tokyo/tokyo_tower/tokyo_64.JPG" alt=""><br>They
dances in circles along with traditional music. &nbsp;The dancers in
the smaller circle on the platform knew what they were doing, while
everyone in the larger circle just followed their movements.<br><br><br><img src="images/tokyo/tokyo_tower/tokyo_70.JPG" alt=""><br>In the very center, a drummer kept a steady beat for everyone.<br><br><br><br><br><a href="tokyo.html">Back</a><br></div></body></html>
