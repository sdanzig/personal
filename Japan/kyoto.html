was common for Japanese to ride around on their bikes with baskets.
&nbsp;They'd often hold an umbrella to block the sun. &nbsp;I have a
hard enough time checking my watch on a bike, let alone hold an
umbrella.<br><br><br><img src="images/kyoto/kyoto_59.JPG" alt=""><br>This
is a hostel we passed by near our ryokan. &nbsp;There was a bar
attached, the Zen Cafe, which provided drinks for much cheaper than the
rest of Kyoto, and provided a friendly youthful atmosphere.<br><br><br><img src="images/kyoto/kyoto_60.JPG" alt=""><br>Here
are some of the people who also were fortunate enough to discover the
Zen Cafe. &nbsp;Most of these people were from the hostel.<br><br><br><img src="images/kyoto/kyoto_5.jpg" alt=""><br>This was a shot from a typical Japanese TV show we were watching in Kyoto.<br><br><br><img style="width: 1024px; height: 768px;" src="images/kyoto/kyoto_43.JPG" alt=""><br>This
is a nice shot of the group in Kyoto. &nbsp;We went drinking after the
trip to the expensive restaurant. &nbsp;Unfortunately, by this time,
Miller turned in for the night so he wasn't here. &nbsp;From right to
left, Paul, Jay, his girlfriend Chiemi, and a couple that Chiemi is
friends with. &nbsp;I forget their names. &nbsp;Then there's me of
course. &nbsp;On the way to this bar, Paul and I bought this tasty
treat called "mochi". &nbsp;These were balls about the size of truffles
that had a chewy texture to them. &nbsp;They were sweet and very good.
&nbsp;I recommend trying them. &nbsp;We let everyone here try it and
they liked it too.<br><br><br><a href="kyoto_temples.html">Temple-hopping</a><br><a href="kyoto_expensive_restaurant.html"><br>The expensive restaurant</a><br><br><br><br><br><br><a href="index.html">Back</a><br></div></body></html>
