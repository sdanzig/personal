is a town a short train ride away from Tokyo. &nbsp;Some background
about why we went there. &nbsp;I'm a New York Mets baseball fan.
&nbsp;The team used to be managed by a man named Bobby Valentine.
&nbsp;He earned my respect and affection as a fan, and was also
entertaining. &nbsp;At the time, the Mets were doing awful and the
manager was quite boring. &nbsp;They were in the market for a new
manager. &nbsp;Bobby Valentine is, at the time I write this, managing
the Chiba Lotte Marines in Japan and very highly respected out there.
&nbsp;In fact, they treat him like a god, and present him with flowers
before every game. &nbsp;He even has a statue of his likeness in front
of the stadium. &nbsp;I was hoping maybe I'd get to see him and
convince him to come back to New York. &nbsp;When we arrived at Chiba
though, our first mission was food, and we found the Long Branch Saloon.<br><br><br><img src="images/chiba/chiba_5.jpg" alt=""><br>We had a waitress with a bright smile and a fashionable hat. &nbsp;The food was okay.<br><br><br><img src="images/chiba/chiba_6.jpg" alt=""><br>Here's some of the food. &nbsp;Taco salad I think. &nbsp;Not nearly as Japanese as the restaurant's name suggested.<br><br><br><img src="images/chiba/chiba_4.jpg" alt=""><br>Here's the Marines' stadium.<br><br><br><img src="images/chiba/chiba_2.jpg" alt=""><br>The mascots of the Chiba Lotte Marines, me, and Miller.<br><br><br><img src="images/chiba/chiba_9.jpg" alt=""><br>Here's
that statue of Bobby Valentine I mentioned. &nbsp;Everything is
actually fairly close to life-sized, except the thumb. &nbsp;I bought a
Marines jersey by the way.<br><br><br><img src="images/chiba/chiba_8.jpg" alt=""><br>I
bought tickets for this game well in advance in the states, through
japanball.com, and had the tickets delivered to our ryokan (hotel) in
Tokyo.<br><br><br><img src="images/chiba/chiba_7.jpg" alt=""><br>Warm-ups on the field before the game. &nbsp;I was just trying to find Bobby Valentine.<br><br><br><img src="images/chiba/chiba_10.jpg" alt=""><br>Some wore a cozy-looking Marines yukata
at the game. &nbsp;The flower in the hair is certainly something you
wouldn't see often at a baseball game in the states. &nbsp;That's too
bad.<br><br><br><img src="images/chiba/chiba_13.jpg" alt=""><br>Found
him! &nbsp;The dude on the fence is Bobby Valentine, who wears the
number 2. &nbsp;I took this picture at full zoom (16x), so I couldn't
tell this picture was of him until later, when I could see the full
resolution photo. &nbsp;I could sort of tell it was him by the
mannerisms and how people acted around him.<br><br><br><img src="images/chiba/chiba_19.jpg" alt=""><br>The
mascot, Bobby Valentine, and a kid. &nbsp;What's that guy in blue?
&nbsp;I think that was the Orix Buffaloes manager, also presented with
flowers. &nbsp;I'm glad for that, because it'd be a little weird if
Valentine was the only one who received flowers.<br><br><br><img src="images/chiba/chiba_18.jpg" alt=""><br>This is Bobby Valentine, displayed on the scoreboard, walking back to the dugout with the flowers presented to him.<br><br><br><img src="images/chiba/chiba_17.jpg" alt=""><br>The two bright-eyed mascots, and some girl with a baseball. &nbsp;I totally forget why she was out there.<br><br><br><img src="images/chiba/chiba_16.jpg" alt=""><br>Here's a shot of a lot of the Marines baseball players in the dugout.<br><br><br><img src="images/chiba/chiba_15.jpg" alt=""><br>Cheerleaders accompanied the mascot, marching around, rallying up the fans.<br><br><br><img src="images/chiba/chiba_12.jpg" alt=""><br>More practicing on the field before the game.<br><br><br><img src="images/chiba/chiba_11.jpg" alt=""><br>Players started to get to their positions on the field as the grounds crew put the final touches on the field.<br><br><br><img src="images/chiba/chiba_20.jpg" alt=""><br>The home plate area is being fixed up and repainted as the mascot and her hooligans wreak more havoc on the field.<br><br><br><img src="images/chiba/chiba_25.jpg" alt=""><img src="images/chiba/chiba_24.jpg" alt=""><img src="images/chiba/chiba_23.jpg" alt=""><img src="images/chiba/chiba_22.jpg" alt=""><br>Here
are shots of various players during the game. &nbsp;The first one,
labeled "Benny", is Benny Agbayani. &nbsp;He's a somewhat stocky
Hawaiian guy who used to play on the Mets when Bobby Valentine managed.
&nbsp;He was good but never really that impressive. &nbsp;I can see him
being a success in Japan, which is admittedly a bit less competitive
than the Major League teams in the US.<br><br><br><img src="images/chiba/chiba_21.jpg" alt=""><br>Batter, catcher, umpire, all waiting for the next pitch.<br><br><br><img src="images/chiba/chiba_32.jpg" alt=""><br>When
a pitcher got pulled from the game, this silver Volvo drove out to the
pitcher's mound with the new pitcher, and the current one jumped in to
be driven away. &nbsp;Big time-saver I guess. &nbsp;It's different, so
I like it.<br><br><br><img src="images/chiba/chiba_31.jpg" alt=""><img src="images/chiba/chiba_28.jpg" alt=""><img src="images/chiba/chiba_33.jpg" alt=""><br>More action shots from the game, along with that car again. &nbsp;You can see Benny Agbayani reaching first base in this shot.<br><br><br><img src="images/chiba/chiba_29.jpg" alt=""><img src="images/chiba/chiba_27.jpg" alt=""><br clear="all"><img src="images/chiba/chiba_14.jpg" alt=""><img src="images/chiba/chiba_30.jpg" alt=""><br>The
stadium was saturated with Japanese girls selling beer. &nbsp;If you
want to buy beer from pretty women, perhaps you should get into
Japanese baseball. &nbsp;One older fan near us had a favorite beer girl
and got all giddy every time she approached. &nbsp;A bit creepy, but
who am I to judge anyone? &nbsp;So the Marines were leading something
like 9-1 and finished the game 9-8. &nbsp;As a Mets fan, this felt
normal to me. &nbsp;Trust me. &nbsp;The amazing thing was there was a
grand slam by each side. &nbsp;The fans were absolutely amazing, having
a different theme song for every Marine that went up to bat. &nbsp;I
had a wonderful time, and I think that's the most important thing, even
if Japanese beer isn't that good.<br><br><br><br><br><a href="index.html">Back</a><br></div></body></html>
