Tokyo, we stayed at a Japanese-style hotel called a "ryokan". &nbsp;See
the bamboo floors and sliding paper doors which let you know whether
you're in one or not.<br><br><br><img src="images/tokyo/ryokan/arrival_in_tokyo_5.jpg" alt=""><br>No standard mattresses will be found in ryokans. &nbsp;Three futons were lined up along the far wall.<br><br><br><img src="images/tokyo/ryokan/arrival_in_tokyo_3.jpg" alt=""><br>It is customary to be given tea (iced in the summer) upon the guests' arrival. &nbsp;That's Paul glancing up at the camera.<br><br><br><img src="images/tokyo/ryokan/arrival_in_tokyo_4.jpg" alt=""><br>Underneath some of these tables, there is a pit which lets you sit more comfortably, rather than cross-legged.<br><br><br><img src="images/tokyo/ryokan/arrival_in_tokyo_15.jpg" alt=""><br>This
was my hobby for about 10 minutes, when I tried to figure out what this
device did and how to operate it. &nbsp;I learned it was a hot water
heater, excellent for making tea, and you can set how hot the water
will be. &nbsp;You'll need to convert to Celsius though.<br><br><br><img src="images/tokyo/ryokan/tokyo_1.JPG" alt=""><br>We
flipped around the stations on the television, and this was the show we
fell in love with. &nbsp;There's a sport played by two teams of kids.
&nbsp;One team has a kid with a paper airplane (like a quarterback) and
some teammates with nets. &nbsp;Their goal is to toss the paper
airplane forward and catch it in one of the nets. &nbsp;If it's caught
in the endzone, they score. &nbsp;The other team has big fans, and they
use them to try to blow the paper airplane off-course.<br><br><br><br><a href="tokyo.html">Back</a><br></div></body></html>
