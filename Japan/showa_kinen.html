I am at Showa Kinen Park in Tokyo. &nbsp;This is a CouchSurfing.com
get-together in Tokyo. &nbsp;The CouchSurfing project is something that
I hold near and dear to my heart. &nbsp;If you're going off to some
remote destination and want to be shown around and/or hosted by a
local, you can go on www.couchsurfing.com and search for someone to
host you. &nbsp;You can also host someone from another country.
&nbsp;I've tried it a couple of times and it's been an awesome
experience every time. &nbsp;They also have frequent meetups for people
into couchsurfing or interested in it. &nbsp;On the website, I heard
about a couchsurfing picnic going on during the fireworks in this park,
so I was all for it. &nbsp;You can see here they're all a friendly
bunch. &nbsp;You don't really get involved in couchsurfing unless you
like other people. &nbsp;Here I was trying to take my own picture.
&nbsp;The first one was completely off, so this bunch was very
forgiving when they acted all cheerful for a second attempt.<br><br><br><img src="images/tokyo/showa_kinen_park/scott_in_katakana.JPG" alt=""><br>We
had a signup sheet, and the lady at the table was nice enough to write
my name in katakana, a Japanese script used for writing foreign words.
&nbsp;I took a picture of it, and showed Japanese speakers the picture
when they asked me my name.<br><br><br><img src="images/tokyo/showa_kinen_park/tokyo_120.jpg" alt=""><br>Second
from the left is Monique, a couchsurfer from California, at the time
planning to next visit her relatives in Thailand. &nbsp;The other three
were locals, training to be flight attendants. &nbsp;Apparently it's a
very competitive field, and they have to study for years. &nbsp;I
remember the name of the girl on the far left, Irimi. &nbsp;Her name
means "close" or "near". &nbsp;It's a word I use in aikido as well.<br><br><br><img src="images/tokyo/showa_kinen_park/tokyo_119.jpg" alt=""><br>I will look forward to future flights to Japan thanks to these three.<br><br><br><img src="images/tokyo/showa_kinen_park/tokyo_123.jpg" alt=""><br>I will not look forward to Domino's pizza though, although these two were great.<br><br><br><img src="images/tokyo/showa_kinen_park/tokyo_122.jpg" alt=""><br>The
ten bucks I spent got me as much of this food as I wanted, plus other
food, and unlimited beer. &nbsp;It was a good deal with good food and
good people. &nbsp;Fireworks too, which you'll see later.<br><br><br><img src="images/tokyo/showa_kinen_park/tokyo_121.jpg" alt=""><br>Here's
a shot of the picnic while it was still light out. &nbsp;They had a
great idea, keeping the beer on ice in the kiddie pool.<br><br><br><img src="images/tokyo/showa_kinen_park/tokyo_127.jpg" alt=""><br>This guy kept the beer on his forehead.<br><br><br><img src="images/tokyo/showa_kinen_park/tokyo_126.jpg" alt=""><br>It
wasn't just the couchsurfers there. &nbsp;We were also hanging out with
a group from Facebook. &nbsp;All the people you see here are from
neither. &nbsp;Japanese people adore fireworks and most of these people
are locals, getting ready to go "Ooooh" and "Aaaah" repeatedly.<br><br><br><img src="images/tokyo/showa_kinen_park/tokyo_150.jpg" alt=""><br>Night
time is upon us. &nbsp;Something you also may have noticed is that many
of the women are wearing yukatas. &nbsp;A good deal of the men too.
&nbsp;Yukatas are traditional and they look stylish. &nbsp;A fireworks
festival is the perfect time to wear one. &nbsp;Also, you get a
discount on the food and beer if you show up in one. &nbsp;I did not.<br><br><br><img src="images/tokyo/showa_kinen_park/tokyo_149.jpg" alt=""><br>How do you get grass stains out of a white shirt? &nbsp;Maybe this guy knows.<br><br><br><img src="images/tokyo/showa_kinen_park/tokyo_147.jpg" alt=""><br>Group shot! &nbsp;Hmm... I see one girl got the bunny ears. &nbsp;Poor girl :(<br><br><br><img src="images/tokyo/showa_kinen_park/tokyo_143.jpg" alt=""><br>Here's a bunny ear-less shot.<br><br><br><img src="images/tokyo/showa_kinen_park/tokyo_146.jpg" alt=""><br>This man exudes confidence.<br><br><br><img src="images/tokyo/showa_kinen_park/tokyo_145.jpg" alt=""><br>Confidence gets you places.<br><br><br><img src="images/tokyo/showa_kinen_park/tokyo_141.jpg" alt=""><br>I
promised the one on the left... I think her name is Shoko... that I
would email her the fireworks pictures when I was done with them.
&nbsp;She might have forgotten all about me by the time I finally
finish typing these silly captions.<br><br><br><img src="images/tokyo/showa_kinen_park/tokyo_140.jpg" alt=""><br>The
girl in the back is definitely drunk. &nbsp;You see the fan in the
lower right? &nbsp;Those things are indispensable in Japanese summers.
&nbsp;It was hot and humid and I was sweating like nobody's business
for the whole two weeks. &nbsp;It was easy to advertise your product by
printing them on these complimentary fans, unless you were someone like
me that couldn't read said advertisements. &nbsp;Speaking of that,
something we saw that was uncanny. &nbsp;It's very rare in Japan to
wear Japanese text on clothing. &nbsp;It's very common, however, to
wear English text. &nbsp;Western culture is very popular in Japan.<br><br><br><img src="images/tokyo/showa_kinen_park/tokyo_144.jpg" alt=""><br>Finally the first few rockets shot off and we had our fireworks.<br><br><br><img src="images/tokyo/showa_kinen_park/tokyo_125.jpg" alt=""><br>I
did not have a tripod with me, so taking shots of fireworks was
difficult. &nbsp;Some small ones like this one came out well enough.<br><br><br><img src="images/tokyo/showa_kinen_park/tokyo_142.jpg" alt=""><br>Here's
a colorful volley of fireworks. &nbsp;If I zoomed in more, you'd see
that you're actually staring at very jagged, unnatural lines, so I
didn't zoom in more.<br><br><br><img src="images/tokyo/showa_kinen_park/tokyo_139.jpg" alt=""><br>Certain types of fireworks didn't come out too badly.<br><br><br><img src="images/tokyo/showa_kinen_park/tokyo_138.jpg" alt=""><br>More bombs bursting in the air.<br><br><br><img src="images/tokyo/showa_kinen_park/tokyo_137.jpg" alt=""><br>Hey, this shot came out really nicely. &nbsp;It looks like something out of a sci fi flick, no?<br><br><br><img src="images/tokyo/showa_kinen_park/tokyo_135.jpg" alt=""><br>I know these orangish, skimpy sprays are a bit ugly. &nbsp;It's the best I could do.<br><br><br><br><img src="images/tokyo/showa_kinen_park/tokyo_133.jpg" alt=""><br>Here, this isn't as skimpy. &nbsp;The purple sprays came out nice.<br><br><br><img src="images/tokyo/showa_kinen_park/tokyo_132.jpg" alt=""><br>I had to zoom in for this one.<br><br><br><br><img src="images/tokyo/showa_kinen_park/tokyo_130.jpg" alt=""><br>This looks like a little yellow-orange flower in front of a field of stars.<br><br><br><img src="images/tokyo/showa_kinen_park/tokyo_129.jpg" alt=""><br>It
was fairly dark out, and my nightvision is horrible. &nbsp;It was not
easy to find the group again after each bathroom trip. &nbsp;However,
at least I didn't have to wait on the massive line for the lady's room.<br><br><br><img src="images/tokyo/showa_kinen_park/tokyo_128.jpg" alt=""><br>Lots of streaky lines mesh in a big jumble in the sky.<br><br><br><img src="images/tokyo/showa_kinen_park/tokyo_124.jpg" alt=""><br>This
was my last attempt to take a picture of fireworks without a tripod.
&nbsp;It came out well enough to look decent at this crappy resolution.<br><br><br><img src="images/tokyo/showa_kinen_park/tokyo_148.jpg" alt=""><br>After
the picnic, some of us made it to an Irish bar owned by a guy who
called him self "Shogun". &nbsp;He was the shogun of Guinness for
certain. &nbsp;Mone in the back seems to be laughing at something.
&nbsp;She was very aware of how easily I could miss the last train back
to my hotel, and had completely laid out the times for the trains and
the stations to switch at. &nbsp;Very good organizer! &nbsp;Will miss them.<br><br><br><br><br><a href="tokyo.html">Back</a><br></div></body></html>
