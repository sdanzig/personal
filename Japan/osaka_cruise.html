Miller and I went for a cruise tour of Osaka. &nbsp;The bridge isn't
the important thing. &nbsp;You can see a view of Osaka Castle in the
background. &nbsp;Otherwise I might've chucked this picture.<br><br><br><img src="images/osaka/cruise/osaka_4.jpg" alt=""><br>We passed this very unique bridge in Osaka. &nbsp;I could have sworn I've seen other unique bridges just like it though.<br><br><br><img src="images/osaka/cruise/osaka_11.jpg" alt=""><br>In the distance we saw colorful buoys spread across the water.<br><br><br><img src="images/osaka/cruise/osaka_7.jpg" alt=""><img src="images/osaka/cruise/osaka_8.jpg" alt=""><img src="images/osaka/cruise/osaka_2.jpg" alt=""><br>Near the buoys there were rowing crews racing around.<br><br><br><img src="images/osaka/cruise/osaka_6a.jpg" alt=""><br>Water shimmers along the line of rather undistinguished buildings.<br><br><br><img src="images/osaka/cruise/osaka_6.jpg" alt=""><br>These Osaka buildings looked nice however.<br><br><br><img src="images/osaka/cruise/osaka_5.jpg" alt=""><br>That
building in the back looks like they melted some metal plates over the
building to make a roof, like a slice of cheese on a burger.<br><br><br><img src="images/osaka/cruise/osaka_1.jpg" alt=""><br>This blue and red houseboat can hold a lot of sake I bet.<br><br><br><img src="images/osaka/cruise/osaka_15.jpg" alt=""><br>I saw this pretty tree that I wanted to take a picture of. &nbsp;So I did.<br><br><br><img src="images/osaka/cruise/osaka_14.jpg" alt=""><br>The
boat we were on was a weird boat. &nbsp;You can see the collapsing post
behind Miller's head. &nbsp;When the boat was to go under a bridge or
something, they would first actually lower the ceiling before
proceeding. &nbsp;It actually went lower than shown here. &nbsp;So much
so that we were an inch away from having to duck down.
&nbsp;Fortunately, the ceiling lowered very slowly, so it's unlikely to
cause brain damage.<br><br><br><br><br><a href="osaka.html">Back</a><br></div></body></html>
