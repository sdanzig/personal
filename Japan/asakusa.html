we found this ramen shop, I was rather hungry. &nbsp;We couldn't really
translate the menus very well. &nbsp;We just ordered some things anyway
and hoped for the best.<br><br><br><img src="images/tokyo/asakusa/arrival_in_tokyo_16.jpg" alt=""><br>This shows we made out fairly well. &nbsp;The noodle dishes were absolutely delicious.<br><br><br><img src="images/tokyo/asakusa/arrival_in_tokyo_14.jpg" alt=""><br>Unfortunately, some of the more dangerous-looking statues had to be kept in a cage.<br><br><br><img src="images/tokyo/asakusa/arrival_in_tokyo_13.jpg" alt=""><br>Scenic temples guide our path.<br><br><br><img src="images/tokyo/asakusa/arrival_in_tokyo_12.jpg" alt=""><br>Here's my friend Miller next to a pot of mist.<br><br><br><img src="images/tokyo/asakusa/arrival_in_tokyo_11.jpg" alt=""><br>The stone warrior stands bravely over much tinier stone dragons.<br><br><br><img src="images/tokyo/asakusa/arrival_in_tokyo_10.jpg" alt=""><br>Paths
