was actually my first view of what a Japanese "castle" was like.
&nbsp;There was no drawbridge, no princess in a tower, no dragon on
top. &nbsp;There was a moat, however. &nbsp;Here wasn't the castle
itself. &nbsp;Just a decorative building in the corner.<br><br><br><img src="images/nagoya/nagoya_castle/nagoya_6.jpg" alt=""><br>I didn't feel like swimming down this way, but I think it was a dead end.<br><br><br><img src="images/nagoya/nagoya_castle/nagoya_8.jpg" alt=""><br>Here's a map of the layout of Nagoya castle. &nbsp;If nothing else, it told me where the restrooms are.<br><br><br><img src="images/nagoya/nagoya_castle/nagoya_7.jpg" alt=""><br>I saw these guys taking a picture in front
of a big golden fish. &nbsp;I wasn't sure about the significance of
said fish, but I started to ponder just what this fish was all about.<br><br><br><img src="images/nagoya/nagoya_castle/nagoya_9.jpg" alt=""><br>Here's a shot of Nagoya castle, in all its splendor. &nbsp;Yay for cliches.<br><br><br><img src="images/nagoya/nagoya_castle/nagoya_10.jpg" alt=""><br>Another shot of Nagoya castle.<br><br><br><img src="images/nagoya/nagoya_castle/nagoya_25.jpg" alt=""><br>It was hot and humid all over Japan. &nbsp;That would not stop me from getting my picture taken with the castle.<br><br><br><img src="images/nagoya/nagoya_castle/nagoya_21.jpg" alt=""><img src="images/nagoya/nagoya_castle/nagoya_14.jpg" alt=""><br>Inside
the castle, I saw the golden fish again. &nbsp;There was an
explanation, so I figured I'd finally learn why this fish is so
special. &nbsp;The explanation was in Japanese though, which I cannot
read. &nbsp;Later on, as I'm putting together this web page, I looked
it up on Wikipedia. &nbsp;This golden fish is called
"Kin-no-Shachihoko". &nbsp;It's the symbol of Nagoya. &nbsp;That's why
it's famous, as far as I can tell.<br><br><br><img src="images/nagoya/nagoya_castle/nagoya_22.jpg" alt=""><br>Arquebuses for display in Nagoya castle.<br><br><br><img src="images/nagoya/nagoya_castle/nagoya_13.jpg" alt=""><br>Authentic samurai outfits on display.<br><br><br><img src="images/nagoya/nagoya_castle/nagoya_23.jpg" alt=""><br>Cartoonish
nobles of the past are described on the wall. &nbsp;Japanese art is
serene and peaceful, and so were there rulers. &nbsp;Well, maybe not
all of them. &nbsp;The one in the middle seems upset at being drawn
with a small head.<br><br><br><img src="images/nagoya/nagoya_castle/nagoya_15.jpg" alt=""><br>Here's a 3D historical model of the Nagoya Castle&nbsp;and its surroundings.<br><br><br><img src="images/nagoya/nagoya_castle/nagoya_19.jpg" alt=""><br>I was able to climb to the top of this castle and get some sweeping views.<br><br><br><img src="images/nagoya/nagoya_castle/nagoya_18.jpg" alt=""><br>Nagoya castle was richly immersed in foliage despite its urban surroundings.<br><br><br><img src="images/nagoya/nagoya_castle/nagoya_16.jpg" alt=""><br>An overhead shot of a temple in Nagoya.<br><br><br><img src="images/nagoya/nagoya_castle/nagoya_12.jpg" alt=""><br>You can see the water separating the castle from the bustling city around it.<br><br><br><img src="images/nagoya/nagoya_castle/nagoya_24.jpg" alt=""><br>Temples
hide in the bushes around Nagoya castle. &nbsp;Sorry, there's not much
else to say about this castle. &nbsp;At least not as an English speaker.<br><br><br><br><br><a href="nagoya.html">Back</a><br></div></body></html>
