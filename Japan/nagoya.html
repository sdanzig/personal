realized, as I was planning this vacation, that a train we were taking,
from the Mt. Fuji area to Osaka, crossed through Nagoya. &nbsp;Nagoya I
later learned was the city where the style of aikido I practice had
originated. &nbsp;I decided I should see if I could drop in for a
class. &nbsp;Apparently, I was a little short-sighted, as it is
customary to submit a formal letter requesting a&nbsp;visit, and
there's a chain of people that must approve it before I'm allowed to
attend a class. &nbsp;Even if I'm allowed to attend, it's usually just
to watch. &nbsp;However, as luck/misfortune would have it, the head
sensei was in Pennsylvania while I was in Nagoya. &nbsp;We almost
switched places. &nbsp;Since he was not there, I was allowed to
participate in the class. &nbsp;They weren't sure if I'd be allowed to
attend both classes (there were two in a row) because I only had one
gi, and I'd be sweating a lot. &nbsp;Lots of people attended the class
I went to. &nbsp;They were all black belts there. &nbsp;I, the puny
orange belt (less than one year of training, as opposed to 10+ years)
was brought in front of everyone and asked to introduce myself.
&nbsp;Someone translated for me. &nbsp;I said it was an honor to meet
all of them, and they applauded. &nbsp;I then tried to sit down, and
they told me I wasn't allowed to sit near the women. &nbsp;I moved, and
then endured the first class. &nbsp;It was so hot in that
dojo,&nbsp;mosquitos were picking at us, and I was exhausted,
especially after Mount Fuji, so I figured maybe it was a good thing if
I only participated in the first session. &nbsp;Those vending machines
in the picture were very important. &nbsp;There are vending machines on
every street in Japan. &nbsp;Well, maybe not every street, but you
never worried about ever finding something to drink, because there was
always a vending machine within sight. &nbsp;Anyway, they let me
participate in the second session too though. &nbsp;One good thing
about aikido is that the more relaxed you are, without using strength,
the better your technique. &nbsp;Since I was so worn out, my muscles
weren't capable of doing anything, so I think my technique improved.
&nbsp;After class, I raided the vending machines again and was on my
way.<br><br><br><img src="images/nagoya/nagoya_27.jpg" alt=""><br>Here's a nice shot of Nagoya.<br><br><br><img src="images/nagoya/nagoya_29.jpg" alt=""><img src="images/nagoya/nagoya_30.jpg" alt=""><br>In the water, I saw this turtle. &nbsp;I love turtles, and I think this one returned the affection.<br><br><br><a href="nagoya_restaurant.html">Restaurant</a><br><br><a href="nagoya_castle.html">Nagoya Castle</a><br><br><br><br><br><a href="index.html">Back</a><br></div></body></html>
