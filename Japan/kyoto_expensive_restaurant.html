restaurant we were going to in Kyoto had three main themes. &nbsp;The
first theme was waterfalls. &nbsp;The dining area was on a platform
over a cascading waterfall. &nbsp;This was one of the waterfalls along
the river, but the waterfall we were at was not nearly as high.
&nbsp;Too bad, in retrospect, because the mist would have felt very
good. &nbsp;The second theme was the food. &nbsp;As you will see, it is
a thoroughly Japanese meal, with foods that I've never seen before.
&nbsp;Perhaps I have not been watching Iron Chef enough. &nbsp;The
third theme was the yukatas. &nbsp;If you pay more, they let you choose
a yukata to keep, which you can wear while dining.<br><br><br><img src="images/kyoto/expensive_restaurant/kyoto_48.JPG" alt=""><br>A 5-legged stick bug mounts an assault on Paul.<br><br><br><img src="images/kyoto/expensive_restaurant/kyoto_51.JPG" alt=""><br>Chiemi,
posing for me this time! &nbsp;Meanwhile, I was experimenting with the
shutter speed, to make the waterfall look good too.<br><br><br><img src="images/kyoto/expensive_restaurant/kyoto_52.JPG" alt=""><br>Chiemi's friend in her yukata.<br><br><br><img src="images/kyoto/expensive_restaurant/kyoto_57.JPG" alt=""><br>Here's
the initial assortment of food they laid out for us. &nbsp;The bottle
of Coke seems out of place. &nbsp;Anyway, I liked the square thing in
the lower left. &nbsp;It was pumpkin tofu. &nbsp;Very subtle flavor
that you'll only taste if someone tells you it's pumpkin tofu.
&nbsp;Pumpkin has a very subtle flavor. &nbsp;I tried making beer with
pumpkin once. &nbsp;A lot of it. &nbsp;I didn't taste the pumpkin much
at all. &nbsp;The trick is to use pumpkin pie spices instead.
&nbsp;Maybe I would have enjoyed pumpkin pie spice tofu more, but Japan
was about everything being simple and delicate.<br><br><br><img src="images/kyoto/expensive_restaurant/kyoto_58.JPG" alt=""><br>Here's a better view of the crazy food I was eating. &nbsp;It was all good though.<br><br><br><img src="images/kyoto/expensive_restaurant/kyoto_50.JPG" alt=""><br>Next to our table, I saw this spider on a web.<br><br><br><img src="images/kyoto/expensive_restaurant/kyoto_54.JPG" alt=""><br>Good time for the camera zoom. &nbsp;If you look closely, it seems like there's a little face on the spider.<br><br><br><img src="images/kyoto/expensive_restaurant/kyoto_56.JPG" alt=""><br>This
was the star of the evening. &nbsp;It was crunchy and crispy. &nbsp;I
saw this and gulped, realizing I was going to feel the fish face in my
mouth. &nbsp;I grabbed the thing, held my breath, and chomped the head
off quickly, chewing as fast as I could. &nbsp;I could feel everything
on my tongue, especially the jaw bone. &nbsp;It was so awful! &nbsp;The
rest of the fish was good though. &nbsp;Nice and salty.<br><br><br>&nbsp;<img src="images/kyoto/expensive_restaurant/kyoto_44.JPG" alt=""><br>Paul ate the fish too. &nbsp;He said the jawbone got stuck in his teeth.<br><br><br><img src="images/kyoto/expensive_restaurant/kyoto_47.JPG" alt=""><br>Near
the restaurant there was a shrine we went to visit. &nbsp;After Mt.
Fuji, like every other physical challenge I'll ever encounter, this was
nothing.<br><br><br><img src="images/kyoto/expensive_restaurant/kyoto_53.JPG" alt=""><br>How
this Shinto tradition works is as follows. &nbsp;You buy a fortune on a
tightly wrapped slip of paper. &nbsp;If it's good, you can make another
contribution if you wish or just run away happy. &nbsp;If it's bad, you
can tie it to one of those poor trees, with the hopes that the gods
will "take it back".<br><br><br><img src="images/kyoto/expensive_restaurant/kyoto_55.JPG" alt=""><br>Here's
a fortune I decided to buy. &nbsp;You buy a blank sheet of paper, put
it in the icy water, and then wait for the symbols to appear.
&nbsp;Fortunately, I had people to translate. &nbsp;Most of it was
good. &nbsp;Each of the ten columns is a different fortune. &nbsp;The
one that hit home the most was along the lines of "A move northeast
will bring you good fortune." &nbsp;My home, at the time, was in New
Jersey. &nbsp;Just before this trip, I had accepted a new job in
Boston, to the northeast. &nbsp;If it was any other direction, I would
have shrugged it off as silly, but nope, I'm convinced. &nbsp;Shinto is
the best religion. &nbsp;Another column that I did not appreciate said
"Beware of accidents". &nbsp;Leading up to this dinner, I had hit my
head over forty times due to the low doorways being just high enough
for me not to see them. &nbsp;Just before dinner, I hit my head going
to the bathroom, and the walls had this stucco texture, so it actually
drew blood. &nbsp;I cleaned up as best I could during dinner.
&nbsp;During dinner, I spilled some soup all over the table. &nbsp;This
fortune came WAY too late.<br><br><br><br><br><br><a href="kyoto.html">Back</a><br></div></body></html>
