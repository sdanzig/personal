it was time to go. &nbsp;My oriental experience was about to end.
&nbsp;Never again will I see a Japanese person. &nbsp;Well, one of my
new officemates is Japanese, so maybe that's not the case. &nbsp;When
we were waiting in the airport, we saw small people surround us.
&nbsp;Most Japanese people are smaller than us, but these people were
unusually small. &nbsp;We look up and see these children. &nbsp;They
had Paul surrounded. &nbsp;Each one of the little sorceresses said her
name aloud, then, in unison, as if they were possessed, chanted "May we
ask you some questions?" &nbsp;They silently waited for an answer.
&nbsp;Paul relented with an affirmation.<br><br><br><img src="images/flights/back_home/flight_home_7.jpg" alt=""><br>They
had Paul stare at their mystical symbols and choose which identified
his weakness. &nbsp;Then after continuing to chant and flipping through
the rest of their parchments, they ensorcelled Miller and I fell victim
last. &nbsp;It's possible they were not sorceresses and instead some
kids from an English class just getting some practice, but, I find that
hard to believe.<br><br><br><img src="images/flights/back_home/flight_home_5.jpg" alt=""><br>As
the plane taxied to the runway, I saw something that amazed me.
&nbsp;The Japanese were so polite during our entire vacation. &nbsp;We
saw four of the ground crew out there lined up, waving to us.&nbsp; It
was such a nice gesture! &nbsp;Finally, we were back up in the air.
&nbsp;We had a far less cloudy view than the flight in. &nbsp;I was
able to see many more mountains.<br><br><br><img src="images/flights/back_home/flight_home_4.jpg" alt=""><br>As
we were flying over alaska, I wondered on occasion if I was looking at
Mount McKinley. &nbsp;I compared these mountains to pictures of Mount
McKinley afterward, and the short answer is "no".<br><br><br><img src="images/flights/back_home/flight_home_3.jpg" alt=""><br>Flying
is fun. &nbsp;Window seats are great, until you need to go to the
bathroom. &nbsp;A guy in the aisle seat, at the beginning of the
flight, told me he was taking a sleeping pill and would be asleep for
the whole flight, and I should just push past him if I wanted to get
out. &nbsp;There was no leg room to begin with, so pushing past someone
sitting there was just about impossible. &nbsp;Fortunately he woke up 3
hours later.<br><br><br><img src="images/flights/back_home/flight_home_2.jpg" alt=""><br>Okay,
enough bitching. &nbsp;Back to the cool mountain shots. &nbsp;After so
much time sweating in sweltering heat, this looked sooooo refreshing.<br><br><br><img src="images/flights/back_home/flight_home_1.jpg" alt=""><br>Well,
this was my last picture before we landed and I realized how much work
it'd be to put all these pictures online. &nbsp;I saw the river down
there and couldn't resist. &nbsp;I would give Japan a big thumbs up
though. &nbsp;I didn't expect it would be as wonderful a vacation as it
was, but it was unforgettable. &nbsp;Especially the fish head.<br><br><br><a href="index.html">Back</a><br></div></body></html>
