reached Osaka and found my friends still recovering from the Fuji
fiasco. &nbsp;They did some initial scouting around in Osaka while I
was in Nagoya. &nbsp;The main plan was to see a kendo practice in a
police station, and maybe also see Osaka castle. &nbsp;This man was an
unexpected surprise. &nbsp;You can see all his equipment here,
including the scary pink thing. &nbsp;He was theatrical and very
focused. &nbsp;We could not understand what he was shouting about (and
he shouted a lot), but we were convinced he was a good actor.<br><br><br><img src="images/osaka/osaka_43.jpg" alt=""><br>There
were lots of free concerts around Japan in general. &nbsp;This seemed
like a "Battle of the Bands" or something, because they were right next
to each other. &nbsp;When you stood in front of each band, 90% of what
you heard was their music, so it worked pretty well.<br><br><br><img src="images/osaka/osaka_42.jpg" alt=""><br>These groupies knew where to get the best view from.<br><br><br><img src="images/osaka/osaka_63.jpg" alt=""><br>We
had a pretty nice hotel room in Osaka. &nbsp;It was near a mall with
tons of retstaurants. &nbsp;Maybe 30-40. &nbsp;I took this shot from
one of the upper floors. &nbsp;You can see they were setting up for
something. &nbsp;You also can see how the mall was laid out. &nbsp;It
was a big open area surrounded by 4 floors on the perimeter.<br><br><br><img src="images/osaka/osaka_62.jpg" alt=""><br>We
chose this sushi bar, and it was a nice choice. &nbsp;This was our main
sake experience in Japan. &nbsp;We probably should have drank more
sake. &nbsp;Because everything required cash in Japan (it was rare for
credit cards to be accepted), we had to budget ourselves at least
somewhat. &nbsp;Here we had a large assortment of sushi and other
treats. &nbsp;We just kept ordering more plates of slimy stuff until we
were full. &nbsp;A Japanese couple sitting at the bar was surprised by
our affinity toward sake.<br><br><br><img src="images/osaka/osaka_64.jpg" alt=""><br>Trees
were lit up in blue lights outside our hotel, the New Otani Hotel.
&nbsp;The hotel presented us with a wonderful view of the Osaka castle
from our window. &nbsp;Charging 30 dollars for the pool was not
appreciated, however.<br><br><br><a href="osaka_cruise.html">Sightseeing cruise</a><br><br><a href="kendo_practice.html">Kendo practice</a><br><br><a href="osaka_castle.html">Osaka Castle</a><br><br><br><br><br><a href="index.html">Back</a><br></div></body></html>
