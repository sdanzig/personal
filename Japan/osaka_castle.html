<body><div style="text-align: center;"><big><big>Osaka Castle</big></big><br><br><br><br><br><img src="images/osaka/osaka_castle/osaka_45.jpg" alt=""><br>Me in front of Osaka Castle. &nbsp;Miller thought this was a really nice shot of the castle. &nbsp;I think he was right.<br><br><br><img src="images/osaka/osaka_castle/osaka_59.jpg" alt=""><br>It could be that the castle was very photogenic, however. &nbsp;This one looks nice too.<br><br><br><img src="images/osaka/osaka_castle/osaka_46.jpg" alt=""><br>Here's an up-close corner shot of the castle I took as Miller and I were trying to find our way in.<br><br><br><img src="images/osaka/osaka_castle/osaka_57.jpg" alt=""><br>Deep
within Osaka Castle hid the samurai armor with chihuahua ears.
&nbsp;Perhaps they were embarrassed, but tourists have good money, so
they let us see it.<br><br><br><img src="images/osaka/osaka_castle/osaka_56.jpg" alt=""><br>They
even had this boy wear the peacock hat. &nbsp;I can see him bending
over and charging into an oncoming army, stabbing... let's see... 29
warriors at once.<br><br><br><img src="images/osaka/osaka_castle/osaka_49.jpg" alt=""><br>We climbed up to the roof and looked down. &nbsp;On the grassy field below was the shadow of Osaka Castle.<br><br><br><img src="images/osaka/osaka_castle/osaka_41.jpg" alt=""><br>You
can see Osaka's buildings past the trees. &nbsp;Directly in front of is
a Kin-no-Shachihoko, the fish that Nagoya uses as its symbol.
&nbsp;Apparently it's a popular castle decoration too.<br>&nbsp;<br><br><img src="images/osaka/osaka_castle/osaka_48.jpg" alt=""><br>Lots
of impressive buildings to stare at. &nbsp;It almost seems like you can
see the smaller buildings through the reflective building on the left.
&nbsp;If you look closely, you'll see it really is a reflection and not
transparent. &nbsp;The disc-shaped building on the right is a UFO.<br><br><br><img src="images/osaka/osaka_castle/osaka_53.jpg" alt=""><br>More of Osaka, and another Kin-no-Shachihoko fish thingy.<br><br><br><img src="images/osaka/osaka_castle/osaka_52.jpg" alt=""><br>Moss
decorates the walls around the moat. &nbsp;There wasn't too much else
left for us in Osaka after this, at least that we knew of. &nbsp;It was
time to move on to Kyoto.<br><br><br><br><br><a href="osaka.html">Back</a><br></div></body></html>
