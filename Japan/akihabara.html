is a city for geeks. &nbsp;I can't get around just saying that
outright. &nbsp;Being a geek, in my opinion, is not a bad thing, but
this was a city for geeks. &nbsp;This is a six foot high replica of a
war-robot/creature found in the Japanese animation (anime) called
"Evangelion".<br><br><br><img src="images/tokyo/akihabara/tokyo_16.JPG" alt=""><br>Some
stores had models of anime characters for sale. &nbsp;They range from
cheap and simple to madly expensive and intricately designed and
painted. &nbsp;This model runs well over one-thousand dollars.<br><br><br><img src="images/tokyo/akihabara/tokyo_15.JPG" alt=""><br>Please do not blackmail me with this.<br><br><br><img src="images/tokyo/akihabara/arrival_in_tokyo_23.jpg" alt=""><br>A battle scene is depicted in this ostentatious model.<br><br><br><img src="images/tokyo/akihabara/arrival_in_tokyo_22.jpg" alt=""><br>Posing with the teddybear creature.<br><br><br><img src="images/tokyo/akihabara/arrival_in_tokyo_21.jpg" alt=""><br>Save trees! &nbsp;Don't print catalogs. &nbsp;Use buildings instead.<br><br><br><img src="images/tokyo/akihabara/arrival_in_tokyo_20.jpg" alt=""><br>This motherboard kiosk is almost hypnotic.<br><br><br><img src="images/tokyo/akihabara/arrival_in_tokyo_19.jpg" alt=""><br>This
is a picture of penguins, to the left. &nbsp;Hard to see behind the
glass. &nbsp;Nothing else for you to see here. &nbsp;Move along.<br><br><br><br><a href="tokyo.html">Back</a><br></div></body></html>
