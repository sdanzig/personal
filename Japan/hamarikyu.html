quest to find a stunning Japanese garden brought me to Hamarikyu
Garden. &nbsp;Actually, I mostly ended up here because I was trying to
get to the Tsukiji fish market, which is on the opposite side of the
river. &nbsp;Nevertheless, I saw a garden and went for it. &nbsp;If you
go to Tokyo, I'd definitely recommend a visit here. &nbsp;It's a
wonderful sight to see, plus you can take a cruise tour from here, and
they have a very convenient array of tourism pamphlets and stuff which
include maps and are very handy.<br><br><br><img src="images/tokyo/hamarikyu/tokyo_182.jpg" alt=""><br>Japanese
bridges always seem to have been poorly planned. &nbsp;I guess they
figure the squared bends in the middle would make us think they meant
it to be that way.<br><br><br><img src="images/tokyo/hamarikyu/tokyo_181.jpg" alt=""><br>The Japanese have a wonderful reverence for the beauty of water.<br><br><br><img src="images/tokyo/hamarikyu/tokyo_180.jpg" alt=""><br>A
footbridge in the distance. &nbsp;If you recognize it from the Tokyo
Tower pictures, that peculiarly&nbsp;shaped&nbsp;building isvisible behind the trees. <br><br><br><img src="images/tokyo/hamarikyu/tokyo_179.jpg" alt=""><br>It
would be nice if I could walk over a bridge like this on the way back
from work. &nbsp;Nope, you have to go to Japan for that, apparently.<br><br><br><img src="images/tokyo/hamarikyu/tokyo_178.jpg" alt=""><br>You can see a tea house in the distance. &nbsp;Those buildings in the background would look tiny if not for this tea house.<br><br><br><img src="images/tokyo/hamarikyu/tokyo_177.jpg" alt=""><br>Here
was something amusing I came across a couple times in Japan.
&nbsp;Every so often, when you're around some arresting scenery, you'll
see photographers and a model. &nbsp;However, the minute they see
you're pulling out your own camera, they will pack up their whole
operation within seconds and run away. &nbsp;That guy holding the
mirror? &nbsp;He just spotted me. &nbsp;Two seconds after this picture
was taken, they were back in the van.<br><br><br><img src="images/tokyo/hamarikyu/tokyo_174.jpg" alt=""><br>Here's a field of tiny orange flowers. &nbsp;I like the fact that it seems natural, like how dandelions sprout up randomly.<br><br><br><img src="images/tokyo/hamarikyu/tokyo_173.jpg" alt=""><br>This
is me testing out my camera's digital macro zoom on one of these
unsuspecting flowers. &nbsp;I recommend you checking out digital macro
in your own camera. &nbsp;In addition to high-res pictures of tiny
flowers, you can take detailed pictures of bugs, and even can see the
fibers in a sheet of paper.<br><br><br><img src="images/tokyo/hamarikyu/tokyo_172.jpg" alt=""><br>More water, and a tree adorned with more flowers.<br><br><br><img src="images/tokyo/hamarikyu/crow_pic.jpg" alt=""><br>A curious bird eyes my camera. &nbsp;These crows are all over Japan, but their squawking sounds eerily human.<br><br><br><br><br><a href="tokyo.html">Back</a><br></div></body></html>
