has a popular fish market in Tsukiji. &nbsp;I arrived on a Sunday
afternoon, when the market was totally closed and desolate. &nbsp;There
was plenty of seafood for sale in the area though.<br><br><br><img src="images/tokyo/tokyo_183.jpg" alt=""><br>These looked kind of weird. &nbsp;I wouldn't want to stick my hand in the water.<br><br><br><img src="images/tokyo/tokyo_116.jpg" alt=""><br>In front of the Pokemon store, two little girls pose for their photo.<br><br><br><img src="images/tokyo/tokyo_114.jpg" alt=""><br>This is the Old Ministry of Justice Building.<br><br><br><img src="images/tokyo/tokyo_113.jpg" alt=""><br>This is how I knew that.<br><br><br><br><img src="images/tokyo/tokyo_69.JPG" alt=""><br>Here's a random summer festival we passed by on a Tokyo train.<br><br><br><img src="images/tokyo/tokyo_68.JPG" alt=""><br>We
asked at the hotel where the nearest "revolving sushi" joint was.
&nbsp;We ended up here, where you order your food on a computer, and
sure enough, within minutes you see your plate of food shoot out on the
conveyor belt.<br><br><br><br><img src="images/tokyo/tokyo_23.JPG" alt=""><br>An exquisitely carved statue in Tokyo.<br><br><br><img src="images/tokyo/tokyo_21.JPG" alt=""><br>Less exquisitely carved but much more adorable animal statues in Tokyo.<br><img src="images/tokyo/tokyo_20.JPG" alt=""><br>Here's a lady taking care of her chimp.<br><br><br><img src="images/tokyo/tokyo_13.JPG" alt=""><br>Buildings in Tokyo, and Tokyo in general, were brightly colored.<br><br><br><img src="images/tokyo/tokyo_12.JPG" alt=""><br>Japan, land of the rising sun. &nbsp;They certainly are not shy of eggs in Japan. &nbsp;The meat was some sort of pork I think.<br><br><br><img src="images/tokyo/tokyo_9.JPG" alt=""><br>On
the trains, stops were displayed on video screens like this one.
&nbsp;I think I got pretty good at remembering kanji letters, thanks to
the station names. &nbsp;In fact, train stations were a good way to
learn some of the kanji, because often they were accompanied by the
"romanized" (English-lettered) text.<br><br><br><img src="images/tokyo/tokyo_5.JPG" alt=""><br>In a mall, a man makes fish cookies.<br><br><br><img src="images/tokyo/tokyo_3.JPG" alt=""><br>A

Discovery what a preying mantis does to these things, I've learned to
appreciate them even more.<br><br><br><img src="images/tokyo/tokyo_2.JPG" alt=""><br>Japan, and especially Tokyo, has all sorts of flashy buildings that come in handy if you forget to shave and need a mirror.<br><br><br><br><a href="ryokan.html">The ryokan</a><br><br><a href="asakusa.html">Asakusa</a><br><br><a href="akihabara.html">Akihabara</a><br><br><a href="shinjuku.html">Shinjuku</a><br><br><a href="kawaguchi.html">Kawaguchi</a><br><br><a href="tokyo_tower.html">Tokyo Tower</a><br><br><a href="tokyo_cleaning_festival.html">Cleaning Festival</a><br><br><a href="hibiya.html">Hibiya Garden</a><br><br><a href="imperial_palace.html">Imperial Palace</a><br><br><a href="hamarikyu.html">Hamarikyu Garden</a><br><br><a href="roppongi.html">Roppongi Hills</a><br><br><a href="showa_kinen.html">Showa Kinen Park</a><br><br><a href="ueno.html">Ueno</a><br><br><br><br><br><a href="index.html">Back</a><br></div></body></html>
