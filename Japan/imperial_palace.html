headed over to the Imperial Palace knowing that I could not get in any
sort of impressive palace-like building. &nbsp;The Imperial Gardens
surrounded it, however, and I wanted to be blown away by some royal
shrubbery. &nbsp;The Imperial Palace area is surrounded by lots of
water which provide a home to these swans.<br><br><br><img src="images/tokyo/imperial_palace/tokyo_72.jpg" alt=""><br>Here's one of the Imperial buildings sitting over the water.<br><br><br><img src="images/tokyo/imperial_palace/tokyo_76.jpg" alt=""><br>As we approached what we thought was the entrance, we realized it was blocked off.<br><br><br><img src="images/tokyo/imperial_palace/tokyo_73.jpg" alt=""><br>Some
security guards were standing by to make sure we took the long way
around before we could enter the Imperial Palace. &nbsp;These were not
those security guards, but I'm sure they all play mahjong together.<br><br><br><img src="images/tokyo/imperial_palace/tokyo_82.jpg" alt=""><br>Here's
a picture we took circling back around. &nbsp;I wanted to go somewhere
new, so I could take a picture of something different. &nbsp;Blame the
security guards.<br><br><br><img src="images/tokyo/imperial_palace/tokyo_75.jpg" alt=""><br>This is an imperial fountain.<br><br><br><img src="images/tokyo/imperial_palace/tokyo_74.jpg" alt=""><br>Okay, this one looked even more imperial.<br><br><br><img src="images/tokyo/imperial_palace/tokyo_81.jpg" alt=""><br>Another large body of water we had to circle around.<br><br><br><img src="images/tokyo/imperial_palace/tokyo_77.jpg" alt=""><br>Still circling. &nbsp;I'm not bitter.<br><br><br><img src="images/tokyo/imperial_palace/tokyo_78.jpg" alt=""><br>We finally reach the entrance! &nbsp;This tree offers shade to the fish below.<br><br><br><img src="images/tokyo/imperial_palace/tokyo_102.jpg" alt=""><br>Here are the shaded fish.<br><br><br><img src="images/tokyo/imperial_palace/tokyo_79.jpg" alt=""><br>This
is the main entrance to the Imperial Garden. &nbsp;When I say "we" on
this page, I'm referring to me and Fred. &nbsp;Fred's the guy in the
lower right in this picture, a nuclear physicist from California that I
met by chance who was on business here in Japan. &nbsp;We both didn't
know where the hell we were going, but we had fun.<br><br><br><img src="images/tokyo/imperial_palace/tokyo_103.jpg" alt=""><br>Fred was nice enough to take a picture of me.<br><br><br><img src="images/tokyo/imperial_palace/tokyo_83.jpg" alt=""><br>Ah,
the royal shrubbery! &nbsp;The
landscapers here do a pretty good job, and we didn't see any of them at
work during my visit. &nbsp;Few trees have the privilege of growing in
the big open grassy field. &nbsp;This one provides shade to some
resting visitors. &nbsp;Here you have a better view of the sharp-angled
shrubbery decorating the field's border.<br><br><br><img src="images/tokyo/imperial_palace/tokyo_86.jpg" alt=""><br>More royal shrubbery, decorating the hillside like a zebra.<br><br><br><img src="images/tokyo/imperial_palace/tokyo_84.jpg" alt=""><br>The Japanese love their beautifully manicured trees and when necessary, bolster awkward branches with wooden supports.<br><br><br><img src="images/tokyo/imperial_palace/tokyo_88.jpg" alt=""><br>A patch of flora along the path, to help my pictures look more professional.<br><br><br><img src="images/tokyo/imperial_palace/tokyo_90.jpg" alt=""><br>My guess is that the monster from Goonies is caged in here. &nbsp;That's why I didn't go in.<br><br><br><img src="images/tokyo/imperial_palace/tokyo_89.jpg" alt=""><br>Here's a temple just outside the Imperial Palace grounds that reminded me of a chef's hat.<br><br><br><img src="images/tokyo/imperial_palace/tokyo_91.jpg" alt=""><br>An artsy, primitive fountain.<br><br><br><img src="images/tokyo/imperial_palace/tokyo_85.jpg" alt=""><br>We
were actually allowed to enter this building on the other side. &nbsp;It
served as a mini-museum, souvenir shop, and information center. &nbsp; I
bought ice cream here.<br><br><br><img src="images/tokyo/imperial_palace/tokyo_92.jpg" alt=""><br>There was an arboretum on the palace grounds, including these palm trees.<br><br><br><br><img src="images/tokyo/imperial_palace/tokyo_100.jpg" alt=""><br>A perfect specimen of an imperial sunflower.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><img src="images/tokyo/imperial_palace/tokyo_98.jpg" alt=""><br>There were several elevated spots on the palace grounds you can climb up to and take pictures.<br><br><br><img src="images/tokyo/imperial_palace/tokyo_99.jpg" alt=""><br>This
is what the palace grounds look like when it's prepared for ceremonial
purposes. &nbsp;Most of the buildings must be built each time.<br><br><br><img src="images/tokyo/imperial_palace/tokyo_96.jpg" alt=""><br>Peaceful Japanese artwork on display in the museum.<br><br><br><img src="images/tokyo/imperial_palace/tokyo_105.jpg" alt=""><br>An expensive looking yet simple vase.<br><br><br><img src="images/tokyo/imperial_palace/tokyo_104.jpg" alt=""><br>A better shot of one of the Japanese artworks.<br><br><br><br><img src="images/tokyo/imperial_palace/tokyo_80.jpg" alt=""><br>Here's the gate leading out. &nbsp;Fred and I parted ways. &nbsp;He went off to Tokyo Tower.<br><br><br><img src="images/tokyo/imperial_palace/tokyo_101.jpg" alt=""><br>It was easy for me to tell him directions to get to Tokyo Tower, because I could point at it.<br><br><br><br><a href="tokyo.html">Back</a><br></div></body></html>
