hotel for our second stay in Tokyo, not pictured here, was in
Kawaguchi. &nbsp;Kawa means river, and guchi means "mouth" or
"entrance". &nbsp;You can tell what the town was named for. &nbsp;I'll
remember it for the colorful video games. &nbsp;I played this one.
&nbsp;I managed to do mostly okay for the first level, where you had to
beat the drums along with slow music. &nbsp;Level two was way too hard.
&nbsp;Once I need coordination, it's not for me.<br><br><br><img src="images/tokyo/kawaguchi/tokyo_19.JPG" alt=""><br>This
horse-racing game involves watching little robotic horses skeeter
around. &nbsp;It just might be more exciting than real horse-racing,
and much more humane.<br><br><br><img src="images/tokyo/kawaguchi/tokyo_18.JPG" alt=""><br>To
play this game, you move cards around over the playing surface to guide
your armies. &nbsp;I was hoping to see the "dog-walking" video game,
where you pull on a leash-like control to steer your dog to the finish
line, but there were enough games with creative designs to hold my
amusement. &nbsp;Video games are pretty much obsolete in the US, but
not here.<br><br><br><br><a href="tokyo.html">Back</a><br></div></body></html>
