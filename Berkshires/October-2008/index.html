weekend at the Berkshires had its share of perversions going on.
&nbsp;William is in the back with the blow-up doll, kicking his legs to
"New York, New York".&nbsp; Jay is climbing towards a giggling Krista.
&nbsp;This is what I saw when I showed up. &nbsp;However, I just drove
for over 5 hours, so I was stuck.<br><br><br><img src="images/004.JPG" alt=""><br>I ignored all these disturbing shenanigans and cuddled up with a teddy bear I found.<br><br><br><img src="images/006.JPG" alt=""><br>Murali, Aliona, Victoria at a table, playing Hoopla. &nbsp;Aliona was peddling her Belarusian candies like nobody's business.<br><br><br><img src="images/007.JPG" alt=""><br>Jay playing beautiful music, with his blow-up backup singers.<br><br><br><img src="images/008.JPG" alt=""><br>The blow-up dolls scared me off, and I went to explore the countryside.<br><br><br><img src="images/009.JPG" alt=""><br>I approached this shy bird and had a wonderful conversation with it.<br><br><br><img src="images/011.JPG" alt=""><br>Treasures awaited us on the other side of Chrysler Lake.<br><br><br><img src="images/012.JPG" alt=""><br>Aliona and I decided to take matters into our own hands. &nbsp;We wanted to see those trees closer! &nbsp;<br><br><br><img src="images/013.JPG" alt=""><br>We
borrowed a nearby rowboat with only one oar (the other was locked
down). &nbsp;Aliona found a rusty snowshovel to paddle with.<br><br><br><img src="images/015.JPG" alt=""><br>Guess who got to paddle with the snowshovel? &nbsp;You thought I was kidding.<br><br><br><img src="images/016.JPG" alt=""><br>Aliona, my partner in crime, with the oar.<br><br><br><img src="images/leaf_pic.jpg" alt=""><br>An artistic rendition of our escapade. &nbsp;There were ducks that flew away from the lake, so I drew one here.<br><br><br><img src="images/026.JPG" alt=""><br>It
took forever to fight the breeze and finally get near the other side.
&nbsp;Rowing through these lily pads was fun, but they didn't help.<br><br><br><img src="images/031.JPG" alt=""><br>We decided this was as pretty as it was going to get, so we steered around and headed back after scaring about 200 ducks away.<br><br><br><img src="images/040.JPG" alt=""><br>Upon
returning to shore, I saw a tree with a ladybug. &nbsp;It was time for
me to bust out the digital macro mode. &nbsp;I spent about 10 minutes
trying to get this bugger in focus. &nbsp;This was the best I could get.<br><br><br><img src="images/041.JPG" alt=""><br>Fortunately for me, he didn't fly away. &nbsp;Just kept crawling.<br><br><br><img src="images/042.JPG" alt=""><br>Aliona was jealous of this well and wanted to use it, but the owners were home, so we left it alone.<br><br><br><img src="images/043.JPG" alt=""><br>Aliona
got over the well, with the comfort of a hammock and a bloody mary.
&nbsp;We determined we really liked the bloody maries, but not too much
at once. &nbsp;They hurt.<br><br><br><img src="images/044.JPG" alt=""><br>Murali
was the first couchsurfer that I ever hosted. &nbsp;I was really happy
to see him show up. &nbsp;However, I didn't chat with him as much as
I'd have liked to. &nbsp;Then again, we talked a lot when I was hosting
him, so perhaps it was time to share the Murali.<br><br><br><img src="images/045.JPG" alt=""><br>Underground
monsters were chewing at Naima's hair. &nbsp;She desperately was
trying to fight off the monster, while looking calm and peaceful for
the camera.<br><br><br><img src="images/046.JPG" alt=""><br>From left
to right, Matt, Aine, Melanie, and Dileep. &nbsp;I remember Matt
because he sat in a box. &nbsp;Aine I'll remember as the
hammock-snatcher. &nbsp;Melanie confessed that one of her nicknames is
"Melicious". &nbsp;Dileep I've known a while ago, starting from a CS
barbecue I hosted in May. &nbsp;We kept sliding into each other during
a volleyball game. &nbsp;Probably my fault, but Dileep doesn't care.
&nbsp;He knows how to stay cool.<br><br><br><img src="images/047.JPG" alt=""><br>Amit preferred to play his music without the blow-up dolls.<br><br><br><img src="images/048.JPG" alt=""><br>I don't think it's possible for Lynn and Kyungmi to look more sunshiny.<br><br><br><img src="images/050.JPG" alt=""><br>Emma
raiding the fridge, with Jenn and Victoria preparing dinner, telling me
to get lost. &nbsp;Is that Jenn giving me the finger?!? &nbsp;I just
wanted to take a picture :(<br><br><br><img src="images/051.JPG" alt=""><br>Aine,
the hammock thief, waited quietly for Aliona and I to get up. &nbsp;In
a flurry of blankets and pillows, she dove onto the hammock.<br><br><br><img src="images/052.JPG" alt=""><br>Here's
a shot of practically everyone that showed up for a weekend of fun and
Victoria's glorious turkey dinner. &nbsp;I can't describe just how good
the food was. &nbsp;I'm not for animal cruelty, but this turkey's
sacrifice was for a very tasty cause. &nbsp;A very interesting soul was
Dave, just behind Melanie on the left. &nbsp;He made wonderful floral
arrangements for the dinner. &nbsp;It couldn't have been more elegant.
&nbsp;The next day, he was seen jumping from trees into leaf piles.<br><br><br><img src="images/053.JPG" alt=""><br>From
the bottom, counter-clockwise: &nbsp;Dileep, Lynn, Jeff, Cynthia,
Katie, Jenn, Ryan. &nbsp;I was just going around snapping pictures of
everyone, and these guys couldn't fit at the red table. &nbsp;Dave's
flowers got moved to this table to cheer them up.<br><br><br><img src="images/054.JPG" alt=""><br>This
was among the most foolish things I've seen in a while. &nbsp;This
bonfire should have been further from the trees :) &nbsp;We spent a
while spraying water around it to contain it. &nbsp;The sparks made me
nervous.<br><br><br><img src="images/055.JPG" alt=""><br>Once the fire calmed down a bit, we took turns going on visionquests.<br><br><br><img src="images/057.JPG" alt=""><br>Matt couldn't find a chair, but the firewood was used up, so this box was comfortable.<br><br><br><img src="images/chair_fall.jpg" alt=""><br>Here's me knocking down my best friend Aliona's chair accidentally. &nbsp;I didn't mean to.<br><br><br><img src="images/061.JPG" alt=""><br>Aliona
and I went for a walk at night to go stargazing. &nbsp;We saw a creepy
house on the way with a table in front of it. &nbsp;I couldn't see what
was on the table, so that's what flash photography is perfect for.
&nbsp;It looked like someone was selling... hamburger condiments?<br><br><br><img src="images/062.JPG" alt=""><br>Victoria
and Dileep were destroying the competition in beer pong. &nbsp;Aliona
and I took a shot at it and got beaten soundly. &nbsp;Lynn and Sergio
were taking their turn here. &nbsp;I don't think they won, but from
what I heard, things did not end too well for Dileep.<br><br><br><img src="images/063.JPG" alt=""><br>Jay plays an original song of his for Aliona and I. &nbsp;Good memories :)<br></font><br><br><br><br><a href="../../adventures.html">Back</a><br></div><big style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><big><big></big></big></big></body></html>
