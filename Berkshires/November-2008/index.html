Aliona, proud member of Team Garbage Juice.<br><br><br>
<img src="n812456_43186298_3594.jpg" alt=""><br>Professor Krueger, also part of Team Garbage Juice, used his claw to pick up litter.<br><br><br><img src="n812456_43186289_1487.jpg" alt=""><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><br>
</span>Here's a picture of "Moonkey" sporting the fashionable green
shorts she tore off of William. &nbsp;If only you knew how cold it
was.<br><br><br><img src="n686591551_1016806_8008.jpg" alt=""><br>Lynn and Brian are gangstas with some fly hoodies. &nbsp;Whazzup withit!?<br><br><br>
<img src="n686591551_1016803_6766.jpg" alt=""><br>
You don't want to see me when I'm angry!<br><br><br><img src="n812456_43186352_8272.jpg" alt=""><br>I drank a lot of interesting things before this picture.<br><br><br><img src="n686591551_1016798_4732.jpg" alt=""><br>Emma
has excellent oratory skills. &nbsp;Her oratory skills are excellent!
&nbsp;Did I mention how excellent Emma's oratory skills were? &nbsp;Try
listening to an excellent oration by Emma. &nbsp;You'll be convinced that Emma has excellent oratory skills. <br><br><br>
<img src="n686591551_1016790_1354.jpg" alt=""><br>
Here's Lynn's impression of "The Grudge".<br><br><br><img src="n686591551_1016765_2967.jpg" alt=""><br>
We played a lot of card games the first night. &nbsp;Drinking games of
course. &nbsp;In this picture, we were very focused on many silly rules
which all resulted in us drinking more beer.<br><br><br><img src="n686591551_1016785_9383.jpg" alt=""><br>Marta
and Jen giggling about stuff on the sofa. &nbsp;Marta has a habit of
closing one eye when she laughs at something. &nbsp;I realized later
that half of her was still sleeping due to my snoring all night.<br><br><br>
<img src="n686591551_1016784_9062.jpg" alt=""><br>
Here is the Big E being an attentive friend, making sure Jen's hair is well-groomed, surely at her request.<br><br><br><img src="n686591551_1016782_8434.jpg" alt=""><br>No one is more goofy than Lynn. &nbsp;Don't even try.<br><br><br>
<img src="n686591551_1016781_8027.jpg" alt=""><br>
This picture shows Melanie and Lynn about to simultaneously burst out in laughter about something.<br><br><br><img src="n686591551_1016778_6828.jpg" alt=""><br>
This picture just looked to wholesome and happy to leave out.<br><br><br><img src="n686591551_1016771_4866.jpg" alt=""><br>Lynn being goofy again.<br><br><br>
<img src="n812456_43186382_8251.jpg" alt=""><br>Luis and Sergio
building a campfire amongst the wet leaves. &nbsp;The fire is much
smaller than last time, but I still didn't feel safe.<br><br><br><img src="n679176373_1216928_2015.jpg" alt=""> <br>When
we had this picture taken, I figured it might very well be the last
picture of us alive. &nbsp;The four of us wanted to go for a boat ride
and attempt to fish. &nbsp;Behind us is a lake encircled by a thick
barrier of broken ice. &nbsp;It was so cold. &nbsp;We ended up just
barely breaking through the ice before the wind pushed us right back
into it. &nbsp;Had to be rescued later. &nbsp;Everyone except Aliona
froze their &nbsp;nuts off.<br><br><br><img style="width: 366px; height: 255px;" alt="" src="boat_pic.bmp"><br>Here's a picture from our adventure on the frozen lake.<br><br><br>
<img src="n679176373_1216924_974.jpg" alt=""><br>
This makes a fine place for a bird to get ice for his rum and coke.<br><br><br><img src="n679176373_1216923_720.jpg" alt=""><br>
Here's a pic of Tranny-D and Big-E laughing up a storm with me and my wicked hat.<br><br><br><img src="n679176373_1216920_9977.jpg" alt=""><br>
Ranajoy and Victoria fear a pimpslap from Marta. &nbsp;Aliona knows she's on her good side<br><br><br><img src="n679176373_1216915_8777.jpg" alt=""><br>
Who knows where that camera has been.<br><br><br><img src="n679176373_1216912_8061.jpg" alt=""><br>
Professor Krueger gets even scarier as he demonstrates chugging a beer through his nose.<br><br><br>
<img src="n679176373_1216906_6702.jpg" alt=""><br>Here's me educating Luis on the difference between real beer and @$$juice.<br><br><br><img src="n812456_43186293_2450.jpg" alt=""><br>Luis has learned! &nbsp;No more @$$juice!<br><br><br>
<img src="n679176373_1216904_6248.jpg" alt=""><br>
Slavic sisters!<br><br><br><img src="n812456_43186446_1487.jpg" alt=""><br>I
read this and
thought, wait, they're not blonde! &nbsp;But then I read the smarmy
little fine print underneath. &nbsp;The Slavic sisters will not be
pleased. &nbsp;Yes, I do realize that Poland is also a Slavic country.
&nbsp;And I also just realized that Emma is actually a blonde, contrary
to what this picture shows. &nbsp;I'm confused.<br><br><br><img src="n679176373_1216903_6021.jpg" alt=""><br>This
is my picture with THE Sergio! &nbsp;Actually, the best thing about him
is that no matter how bad your drunken Spanish is, Sergio will understand
everything!<br><br><br>
<img src="n679176373_1216901_5566.jpg" alt=""><br>Every time we visit Vicky's lodge, we're treated to a really big feast like this one!<br><br><br>
<img src="n679176373_1216939_4953.jpg" alt=""><br>
This feast was sponsored by Burger King.<br><br><br><img src="n679176373_1216932_3049.jpg" alt=""><br>
We had huge appetites, eating everything in front of us. &nbsp;Even this firecracker.<br><br><br><img src="n679176373_1216941_5505.jpg" alt=""><br>Jackpot for chiropractors! &nbsp;You can see Eduardo playing Twister with a bit of an advantage (he's sitting on the floor).<br><br><br><img src="n686591551_1016793_2813.jpg" alt=""><br>
Sergio was tearing up the dance floor. &nbsp;The minute the music came
on, he transformed into the smoothest cat in the alley. &nbsp;Here is
Lynn staking her claim on him.<br><br><br><img src="n812456_43186452_4363.jpg" alt=""><br>They worked the dance floor like pros. &nbsp;Not saying they were hired or
anything. &nbsp;Well, they probably could be like one of those
professional dancing pairs you see at weddings. &nbsp;Much more fun though.<br><br><br>
<img src="n686591551_1016779_7382.jpg" alt=""><br>
Okay, in this picture, Brian looks ALMOST as cool as Sergio.<br><br><br><img src="n812456_43186442_9746.jpg" alt=""><br>Here's Sergio and Brian getting funky with it.<br><br><br>
<img src="n812456_43186439_8463.jpg" alt=""><br>Heyyyy, hooooo, heyyyy, hooooo.<br><br><br>
<img src="n812456_43186438_8020.jpg" alt=""><br>Murali is about to bust the biggest dance move ever. &nbsp;Very tense moment.<br><br><br>
<img src="n686591551_1016824_7525.jpg" alt=""><br>
Here's a picture with a built-in caption. &nbsp;They were having fun
though. &nbsp;Also, if you look from right to left, you can see the
different layers of footwear.<br><br><br><img src="n812456_43186341_4998.jpg" alt=""><br>What a tango pair! &nbsp;I guess Ranajoy is leading?<br><br><br><img src="n812456_43186384_8994.jpg" alt=""><br>Lakes
are wonderful for soothing photography. &nbsp;It's difficult to take a
picture of a lake and it not be soothing. &nbsp;It'd be pretty cool if
a swamp monster popped out though.<br><br><br>
<img src="n812456_43186387_68.jpg" alt=""><br>It is not a good idea to walk on frozen lakes...<br><br><br><img src="n812456_43186388_430.jpg" alt=""><br>... unless you are sure it can support you.<br><br><img src="n812456_43186385_9348.jpg" alt=""><br>Aliens hide in the field, making interesting crop circles.<br><br>
<br>
<img src="n812456_43186378_6818.jpg" alt=""><br>This is what Dileep looks like without the wig.<br><br><br>
<img src="n679176373_1216952_8739.jpg" alt=""><br>We stopped off at this pre-Civil war cemetery.<br><br><br>
<img src="n679176373_1216951_8444.jpg" alt=""><br>
Here's a picture of Lynn turning the sundial so it showed the correct
time. &nbsp;We kept telling her it was a little off, so eventually she
got frustrated, hoisted the sundial overhead, and hurled it into the
forest, knocking an unsuspecting squirrel out of a tree.<br><br><br><img src="n679176373_1216954_9342.jpg" alt=""><br>This
frozen lake looks exactly like the type of lake you see kids suddenly
fall through in movies. &nbsp;Well, while Sergio was leading the pack
sliding from side to side. &nbsp;I decided to see how far I could throw
a stick on the ice. &nbsp;No one but me saw my first toss. &nbsp;It was
rotating for what seemed to be forever. &nbsp;I kept trying to get it
to go further, to no avail. &nbsp;Victoria sidled up to me and
declared, "I wanna throw too!" &nbsp;So I spent the next 10 minutes
finding sticks for her and others. &nbsp;We had an adhoc game of bocce,
with sticks.<br><br><br><img src="n679176373_1216943_6066.jpg" alt=""><br>Here's
us hiking up a cliff. &nbsp;Vic said there'd be a wonderful view at the
top, so we scurried upward dodging ice-patches and mountain lions.<br><br><br><img src="n679176373_1216947_7265.jpg" alt=""><br>
Here's all of us freezing our butts off in front of the gorgeous landscape that Vic promised us.<br><br><br><img style="width: 367px; height: 257px;" alt="" src="abandoned_house.bmp"><br>We
visited an abandoned house. &nbsp;Professor Krueger got feral again, but we
still had fun. &nbsp;From left to right: Murali (top) and Scott (bottom),
Lynn (top) and Krueg (middle) and Melanie (bottom), Sergio, Aliona, and
Victoria. &nbsp;Aliona didn't recognize Lynn in the picture, so she's
clearly marked. &nbsp;Oh, and that's Aliona's title on top too. &nbsp;She would
also like to inform you that she colored in the roof.<br><br><br><img src="n812456_43186372_4759.jpg" alt=""><br>With Amit and Jay missing, Marta manned the guitar. &nbsp;She's really good!<br><br><br>
<img src="n812456_43186369_3754.jpg" alt=""><br>Emma and Luis manned guitars too! &nbsp;Fake ones though.<br><br><br>
<img src="n812456_43186367_3097.jpg" alt=""><br>Frank plays the relaxing music as Jen makes the "Don't talk to me until I've had my coffee!" face.<br><br><br>
<img src="n812456_43186346_6451.jpg" alt=""><br>This tower didn't last long.<br><br><br>
<img src="n812456_43186342_5283.jpg" alt=""><br>Marta's glamor shot.<br><br><br>
<img src="n812456_43186336_3554.jpg" alt=""><br>What people didn't know is that Sergio is screaming because his hat is filled with spiders.<br><br><br>
<img src="n812456_43186321_9371.jpg" alt=""><br>I am the most interesting man in the world, and I drink Dos Equis.<br><br><br><img src="746044081705_0_BG.jpg" alt=""><br>Eduardo
slaves over Victoria's broken sink, fearing reprisal if he does not
successfully fix it. &nbsp;It took him three tries, but he finally
fixed it.<br><br><br><img src="145714081705_0_BG.jpg" alt=""><br>Victoria grudgingly admits that Eduardo did an excellent job.<br><br><br><img src="n812456_43186455_5696.jpg" alt=""><br>Eduardo was a master at Beer Pong, but no one wanted to lose to him. &nbsp;So lonely at the top.<br><br><br><img src="n686591551_1016802_6430.jpg" alt=""><br>
Look at how entranced Lynn is by the big E. &nbsp;It may look like she
is pleading to the picture-taker for help, but she is really just giddy
from Eduardo's charms.<br><br><br><img src="n812456_43186405_6758.jpg" alt=""><br>Eduardo magnifies his teary eye, to emphasize his sensitive side.<br><br><br><img src="n812456_43186325_442.jpg" alt=""><br>Melanie shows her
affection for Big-E, romantically reaching for his hand. &nbsp;Although
Big-E is virtuous and even a bit nervous, he poses for this picture.<br><br><br><img src="n679176373_1216917_9253.jpg" alt=""><br>
Jen and Tranny-D plot to make a move on unsuspecting, innocent
Eduardo. &nbsp;There was no rest for Big-E the whole weekend.
&nbsp;Note that Dileep is not actually a tranny. &nbsp;I mean, he sort
of is in this picture, but it's not really a lifestyle choice.
&nbsp;That wig seems almost natural though, doesn't it?<br><br><br><img src="n812456_43186315_7786.jpg" alt=""><br>Jen&nbsp;takes
advantage of Eduardo as he sleeps. &nbsp;Would you believe that the
next morning, these girls actually blamed poor Eduardo for being the
aggressor? &nbsp;I'm sure he feels so used.<br><br><br><img src="550064081705_0_BG.jpg" alt=""><br>Multiple birthdays are celebrated with delicious cupcakes!<br><br><br><img src="n812456_43186305_5295.jpg" alt=""><br>Everyone had to wear pointy birthday party hats. &nbsp;House rules.<br><br><br><img src="n812456_43186307_5775.jpg" alt=""><br>Marta tires of having her picture taken and makes us put our cameras away.
