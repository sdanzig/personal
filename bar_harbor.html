up with a lot of people at the summit of Cadillac Mountain.
&nbsp;Cadillac Mountain is 1528 feet high. &nbsp;These people were that
high up. &nbsp;While this doesn't compare to Mt. Fuji, you start in
Maine rather than hot and humid Japan, so it was quite cold and windy
even at this elevation. &nbsp;Although most people in this picture are
dressed for the summer, they are cold.<br><br><br><img style="width: 800px; height: 600px;" src="images/bar_harbor/Bar%20Harbor_20090711_11_web.JPG" alt=""><br>A view from the summit. &nbsp;Barriers are set up to protect the fragile life at the top of the mountain.<br><br><br><img style="width: 800px; height: 600px;" src="images/bar_harbor/Bar%20Harbor_20090711_17_web.JPG" alt=""><br>Bar
Harbor is full of some of the best seafood you can munch on.
&nbsp;While the best crab legs I've had was in Portland, Maine, and the
best (and only) whale I've had was in Reykjavik, Iceland, they had, by
far, the best scallops. &nbsp;I can't understand why people don't just
eat scallops. &nbsp;No reason to eat anything else. &nbsp;Not many pics
here, but we didn't have much time.<br><br><br><br><a href="index.html">Back</a></div></body></html>
