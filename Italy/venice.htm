<p><font size="6">Venice</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/venice/italy_0001.JPG" width="640" height="436"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">Here's the busy area we arrived at in Venice.&nbsp; The 
bridges over the Grand Canal, such as this one, were among the many attractive 
elements within the city's mystique.&nbsp; Boats are a main form of 
transportation in Venice.&nbsp; You might buy a pass to use the boats for an 
hour, or the whole day, much like a NYC Metrocard.&nbsp; To the right, you see a 
little waiting area you step into which the boats pull alongside.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/venice/italy_0003.JPG" width="640" height="461"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">Here we are on the Grand Canal.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/venice/italy_0106.JPG" width="640" height="480"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">Sometimes the Grand Canal has a lot of boat traffic.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/venice/italy_0004.JPG" width="531" height="480"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">Lots of little nooks and crannies to row in and out of.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/venice/italy_0005.JPG" width="558" height="480"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">Buildings we floated past were adorned with opulent art.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/venice/italy_0007.JPG" width="640" height="480"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">Here's where we first approached St. Mark's Square.&nbsp; In 
the center, you see the Doge's Palace, an architectural marvel and my favorite 
Italian building.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/venice/doges_palace.jpg" width="640" height="297"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">I didn't get a picture that did justice to the Doge's Palace, 
so I swiped this picture from Wikipedia.&nbsp; You can go into the Doge's Palace 
and tour it.&nbsp; It just gets more and more impressive.&nbsp; There's a 
dungeon in there too.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/venice/italy_0009.JPG" width="800" height="600"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">St. Mark's Basilica is the most noticeable thing once you're 
actually IN St. Mark's Square.&nbsp; Since I noticed it first, I took a picture 
of it first.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/venice/italy_0010.JPG" width="613" height="480"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">I next noticed the live entertainment at the restaurants.&nbsp; 
These guys always have a large crowd and get applause day and night.&nbsp; 
Usually the deserved it too.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/venice/italy_0011.JPG" width="800" height="600"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">St. Mark's Square is known for pigeons.&nbsp; Pigeons think 
St. Mark's Square is known for tourists, but what do those bird brains know 
anyway?&nbsp; Around the square, you can buy little kernels you can feed to the 
pigeons.&nbsp; I saw people holding them in their hands.&nbsp; Birds would hop 
on their arm and munch away.&nbsp; At first I couldn't figure out how to get 
them to jump on my hand.&nbsp; An Italian boy motioned for me to hold my hand 
more open.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/venice/italy_0012.JPG" width="640" height="382"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">A bird saw my food, hopped up, and befriended me.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/venice/italy_0013.JPG" width="640" height="422"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">Make no mistake about it.&nbsp; This is still my arm.&nbsp; 
It's just that it was overrun by a flock of pigeons, all interested in 
purchasing my food.&nbsp; Pigeons are smart enough not to bite the hand that 
feeds them.&nbsp; Squabble as they might, all I felt was the pitter-patter of 
pleasantly warm pigeon feet.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/venice/italy_0014.JPG" width="492" height="480"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">I ended up eventually having to shake them off.&nbsp; This one 
hung on a bit longer to pose for the camera.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/venice/italy_0015.JPG" width="342" height="480"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">When I ran out of food, the pigeons thanked me, hopped away, 
and looked for more.&nbsp; The mother in this picture is trying to get the 
pigeons to traumatize her little boy.&nbsp; Pigeons are not that mean though, so 
they approach him slowly.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/venice/italy_0016.JPG" width="360" height="480"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">Here's a shot as we approach the Doge's Palace on foot.&nbsp; 
There were little carts all over selling souvenirs, as seen on the right.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/venice/italy_0018.JPG" width="360" height="480"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">We of course weren't allowed to take pictures in the Doge's 
Palace, but I leaned out and took this shot of St. Mark's Basilica.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/venice/italy_0019.JPG" width="360" height="480"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">We actually were allowed to take pictures in the dungeon.&nbsp; 
We weren't part of a tour, but we saw this group had a really good tour guide, 
so we stayed within earshot.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/venice/italy_0020.JPG" width="640" height="459"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">The jail cells in Venice are quite spacious and accomodating.&nbsp; 
When Napolean stormed in and freed the inmates, there were only two prisoners.&nbsp; 
The people of Venice, in a gross generalization, were relatively happy and 
fiercely protected their way of life -- until Napolean came along.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/venice/italy_0021.JPG" width="358" height="480"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">They had some of the preserved prison graffiti on display.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/venice/italy_0022.JPG" width="360" height="480"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">There was a part of the Doge's palace sporting all types of 
pillars.&nbsp; This one had faces on it.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/venice/italy_0023.JPG" width="800" height="600"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">Murano, which we visited later, is an island known for its 
fancy colored glass creations.&nbsp; Stores all over Italy, but especially in 
Venice, sold these creations for madly expensive prices.&nbsp; I fawned over 
this glass eagle until I learned it had the MSRP of a Lexus.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/venice/italy_0024.JPG" width="360" height="480"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">Gondolas weaved around the canals of Venice.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/venice/italy_0025.JPG" width="640" height="480"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">Miller in front of the famous Rialto Bridge.&nbsp; Little 
shops lead up and down this bridge, which is the oldest out of the Grand Canal 
bridges</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/venice/italy_0026.JPG" width="640" height="480"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">Here's a view of some of the little shops as we go down the 
Rialto Bridge.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/venice/italy_0027.JPG" width="800" height="600"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">Here's an overhead shot of the Grand Canal from a bridge.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/venice/italy_0028.JPG" width="360" height="480"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">We bought tickets for a concert, Vivaldi's Four Seasons, 
currently being performed nightly in Venice.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/venice/italy_0029.JPG" width="640" height="429"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">Graffiti advertised an upcoming anti-Bush demonstration.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/venice/italy_0030.JPG" width="617" height="480"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">Now you might think this is an artifact of camera perspective 
but it's not.&nbsp; We looked at this from every angle.&nbsp; That tower in the 
middle was seriously leaning to the left.&nbsp; This is Venice, not Pisa, so we 
were a bit concerned.&nbsp; It stayed up long enough for us to finish our 
vacation.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/venice/italy_0031.JPG" width="571" height="480"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">This man couldn't afford an entire guitar, but that didn't get 
him down.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/venice/italy_0032.JPG" width="573" height="480"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">These guys made music with glasses and glass tubes.&nbsp; If 
you've ever seen one of those &quot;singing bowls&quot;, that's essentially what the guy 
on the left was doing.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/venice/italy_0033.JPG" width="320" height="213"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">Shadows of two mechanical men came to life rang the bell of 
the clock tower at St. Mark's Square every hour on the hour.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/venice/italy_0034.JPG" width="360" height="480"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">More scenes of valor sculpted in bronze.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/venice/italy_0035.JPG" width="640" height="373"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">We walked around Venice at night, trying to find the docks of 
the Venetian Arsenal, and were treated to more spectacular views along the way.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/venice/italy_0036.JPG" width="531" height="480"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">Apparently the military closed off the docks.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/venice/italy_0040.JPG" width="640" height="480"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">On the way back we saw buildings lit up along the sea.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/venice/italy_0042.JPG" width="640" height="480"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">St. Mark's Basilica at night.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/venice/italy_0046.JPG" width="640" height="480"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">See, those same entertainers are still fiddling away at night.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/venice/italy_0047.JPG" width="320" height="240"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">There was a Ferrari store near our hotel, so I took a picture 
of the big car in the window.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/venice/italy_0097.JPG" width="598" height="480"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">This picture alone made me want to take up sailing.&nbsp; I'm 
keeping an eye out for a good sailing class.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/venice/italy_0098.JPG" width="800" height="230"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">You can see gondolas floating by.&nbsp; As the man on standing 
on the right sings for the people on his gondola, other gondolas float alongside 
him, so their customers can enjoy the singing too.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/venice/italy_0099.JPG" width="800" height="600"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">Gondolas are well wrapped when not in use.&nbsp; They must 
look fairly pristine to get tourists to pay their prices.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/venice/italy_0100.JPG" width="530" height="480"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">I took a picture of a nice lady's dog.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/venice/italy_0101.JPG" width="360" height="480"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">It was time for the concert.&nbsp; No pictures allowed during 
the concert, so I took this one beforehand.&nbsp; The chairs were weird.&nbsp; 
Three of them were connected, so as one would lean back, the other two would be 
pushed forward.&nbsp; Very annoying.&nbsp; The concert was excellent though.&nbsp; 
The Four Seasons is filled with melodies familiar to everyone.&nbsp; Reading 
&quot;Classical Music for Dummies&quot; beforehand certainly gave me a deeper appreciation 
for it though.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/venice/italy_0103.JPG" width="382" height="480"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">A gondolier possibly done for the night.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/venice/italy_0201.JPG" width="640" height="480"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">There were steps everywhere simply leading down into the 
water.&nbsp; I wouldn't really swim in that water though.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/venice/italy_0202.JPG" width="640" height="480"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">On the way out to the small islands in the Venetian Lagoon, 
Miller spotted this cruise ship, labeled &quot;The World&quot;, docked at Venice.&nbsp; 
The cabins on this ship are actually condos owned by permanent residents.&nbsp; 
You don't have to stay on it of course, but you can.&nbsp; It's a fully 
functioning community with a movie theater, restaurants, grocery store, deli, 
full tennis court, and even classes on things like dancing and language.&nbsp; 
High speed internet access to every room too.&nbsp; It just floats between 
interesting places all around the world.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/venice/venice_islands/italy_0033.JPG" width="331" height="480"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">Lighthouses are always good to take pictures of on the way to 
the islands.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/venice/venice_islands/italy_0034.JPG" width="640" height="480"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">We landed first on a quiet little island named Torcello.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/venice/venice_islands/italy_0001.JPG" width="640" height="480"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">After the downfall of the Roman Empire, this island was one of 
the first to be populated by those fleeing the mainland.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/venice/venice_islands/italy_0002.JPG" width="640" height="480"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">It wasn't hard to take good pictures here.&nbsp; This idyllic 
island actually at one time had a population of 10,000 and was more powerful 
than Venice itself.&nbsp; Now, due to past problems with navigation and malaria, 
it has a population of under 100.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/venice/venice_islands/italy_0036.JPG" width="460" height="480"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">Over this bridge, I could have sworn I saw a cat.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/venice/venice_islands/italy_0037.JPG" width="571" height="480"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">Here's a shot of the lawn of one of the few permanent Torcello 
residents.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/venice/venice_islands/italy_0041.JPG" width="640" height="378"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">Just in case there are any customs agents reading this, no 
officer, I did not touch any of these farm animals.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/venice/venice_islands/italy_0040.JPG" width="590" height="480"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">This goat, however, was on the wrong side of the fence.&nbsp; 
It wasn't causing any trouble though.&nbsp; It just saw the grass was always 
greener and did something about it.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/venice/venice_islands/italy_0042.JPG" width="259" height="240"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">Torcello has ducks too, like this one.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/venice/venice_islands/italy_0003.JPG" width="594" height="480"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">This cat seemed familiar.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/venice/venice_islands/italy_0004.JPG" width="360" height="480"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">The Venetian-Byzantine Torcello Cathedral, largely restored 
around the 10th century, was a prime attraction here.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/venice/venice_islands/italy_0005.JPG" width="640" height="480"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">Here was the other prime attraction.&nbsp; A little museum.&nbsp; 
We bought the audio tour for both.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/venice/venice_islands/italy_0006.JPG" width="640" height="348"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">Here's some artifacts on display outside the museum.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/venice/venice_islands/italy_0007.JPG" width="360" height="480"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">Here's a view inside the Cathedral.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/venice/venice_islands/italy_0008.JPG" width="360" height="480"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">This was the most prominent work of art in the Cathedral.&nbsp; 
Note the Byzantine-style halos around some of the heads.&nbsp; I'm sure you 
could have noted a lot more in a better picture.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/venice/venice_islands/italy_0012.JPG" width="640" height="439"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">There was a bell tower you could go up in for an overhead view 
of the island.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/venice/venice_islands/italy_0013.JPG" width="640" height="238"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">And other islands.&nbsp; This one in particular had 
psychedelic pastel colors.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/venice/venice_islands/italy_0015.JPG" width="360" height="480"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">Here are the bells in the Torcello bell tower.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/venice/venice_islands/italy_0038.JPG" width="484" height="480"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">As we ate, we peeked under a chair and saw that same curious 
furball.&nbsp; We figured we had to leave the island to escape from it, so we 
headed to Murano.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/venice/venice_islands/italy_0028.JPG" width="640" height="480"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">We reached Murano, the glass-making island.&nbsp; The first, 
and only, glass-making factory we entered had flowery decoration at the 
entrance.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/venice/venice_islands/italy_0030.JPG" width="587" height="480"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">These guys, making their glass sculptures, were moving around 
too fast for a camera without a flash, but you can see what he's doing.&nbsp; 
He's got some heated glass on a pole.&nbsp; Not too complicated.&nbsp; What 
happens next is ancient lore that only the workers of Murano know.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/venice/venice_islands/italy_0032.JPG" width="360" height="480"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">This large glass tree served as decoration in a piazza of 
Murano.&nbsp; We visited a few glass-making shops before we left Murano, but I 
was mostly worried about breaking things.&nbsp; Break anything on this island, 
and your children are not going to college.&nbsp; We headed back for our last 
moments in Venice before flying out.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/venice/italy_0203.JPG" width="640" height="480"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">Here's another nice road along Venice.&nbsp; One thing that I 
loved about Venice.&nbsp; Nice elderly ladies would every so often pop their 
heads out of windows and I would wave at them.&nbsp; They would happily wave 
back and carry on a one-sided conversation with me in Italian as I smiled 
stupidly and walked off.</font></p>
