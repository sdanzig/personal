<p><font size="6">Mt. Vesuvius</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/vesuvius/HPIM0143.JPG" width="638" height="480"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">We stopped running away from the big ol' volcano that followed 
us around during our touring of Pompeii.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/vesuvius/IMG_2661.JPG" width="640" height="480"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">We took a bus tour that supposedly would bring us up the 
mountain to a hiking trail that led the rest of the way to the crater at the top 
of the Volcano.&nbsp; This was one of the first views we've had of the mountain 
completely unobstructed by cloud cover.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/vesuvius/IMG_2664.JPG" width="282" height="480"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">Along the road leading up Mt. Vesuvius was a &quot;museum&quot; of 
sculptures carved out of volcanic rock.&nbsp; I liked this one.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/vesuvius/HPIM0206.JPG" width="638" height="480"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">We started to see some eye-catching views the higher the bus 
went.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/vesuvius/HPIM0209.JPG" width="638" height="480"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">The Bay of Naples was sprawling out before us.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/vesuvius/HPIM0215.JPG" width="638" height="480"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">The trails of grey rock were once lava flows.&nbsp; Just a 
note.&nbsp; The tour guide informed us that Mt. Vesuvius did not actually 
destroy Pompeii.&nbsp; It was actually a now inactive volcano named &quot;Montezuma&quot;.&nbsp; 
Mt. Vesuvius, plenty active, formed right alongside it between now and then.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/vesuvius/HPIM0218.JPG" width="638" height="480"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">More views of past lava flows.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/vesuvius/IMG_2670.JPG" width="800" height="600"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">The views of the Bay of Naples that we saw on the way up got 
increasingly impressive.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/vesuvius/IMG_2673.JPG" width="450" height="600"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">We got off the bus and started hiking.&nbsp; The slippery, 
rocky trail zigzagged up the volcano.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/vesuvius/IMG_2675.JPG" width="640" height="480"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">Gorgeous views of the Bay of Naples kept us plenty distracted.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/vesuvius/IMG_2678.JPG" width="360" height="480"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">Looking up the side of the volcano we saw this reddish soil 
that would remind you of Mars.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/vesuvius/IMG_2681.JPG" width="640" height="480"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">We reached the crater at the top after about 45 minutes of 
trucking along.&nbsp; The tour guide's estimate for when we should get back to 
the bus was actually a bit tight, so we didn't have all the time in the world to 
gawk at the magnificent scenery around us, but I think we had enough.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/vesuvius/IMG_2683.JPG" width="360" height="480"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">Note the steam rising out of parts of the crater.&nbsp; They 
told us, on the way up, that the volcano can erupt any day, but they figure 
they'll have a week or two of warning.&nbsp; Vesuvius is actually the most 
dangerous volcano on earth because it's right near a massive population center.&nbsp; 
They figure 600,000 lives are at risk.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/vesuvius/IMG_2685.JPG" width="640" height="480"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">Here's a view looking down into the crater.&nbsp; I thought 
the vegetation growing in there was interesting.&nbsp; Volcanic soil is very 
fertile.&nbsp; So much so, that they sell wine on Mt. Vesuvius that's actually 
grown on the volcano.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/vesuvius/IMG_2687.JPG" width="450" height="600"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">Here's a much better view of the steam.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/vesuvius/IMG_2688.JPG" width="640" height="480"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">Here's what the top of the volcano looked like.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/vesuvius/IMG_2684.JPG" width="800" height="600"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">We of course had to take pictures of ourselves at the top of 
the volcano.&nbsp; Here's Miller, high above the clouds.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/vesuvius/HPIM0227.JPG" width="638" height="480"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">Here's me in front of the crater, hoping that no one pushes me 
in.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/vesuvius/HPIM0230.JPG" width="638" height="480"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">These pictures obviously don't do justice to the sweeping 
views we witnessed.&nbsp; It certainly didn't stop me from taking them, but I 
guess you'll just have to climb the volcano yourself one day, before it erupts 
and kills people.&nbsp; Tick, tick, tick...</font></p>
