<p><font size="6">Sorrento</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/sorrento/IMG_2535.JPG" width="640" height="480"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">There were some nice views on the train ride to Sorrento.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/sorrento/IMG_2537.JPG" width="333" height="480"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">Every so often throughout Italy, just like Munich, you can 
look up to the apex of rocky hills and see the silhouette of a cross.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/sorrento/HPIM0128.JPG" width="638" height="480"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">Lots of palm trees planted all over Italy, including these we 
passed walking from the train station to the hotel.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/sorrento/IMG_2544.JPG" width="450" height="600"><img border="0" src="images/sorrento/HPIM0129.JPG" width="319" height="480"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">Lots of sun and sea.&nbsp; The views from Sorrento were 
beautiful.&nbsp; On the Amalfi coast, I think Sorrento, the land of inlaid wood 
and limoncello, is definitely the place to visit for a fun, relaxing time.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/sorrento/HPIM0130.JPG" width="638" height="480"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">From Sorrento, we finally saw the mystical Mt. Vesuvius in the 
distance.&nbsp; Cruise ships too.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/sorrento/HPIM0136.JPG" width="638" height="480"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">Rocks lined the sunny shores.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/sorrento/HPIM0126.JPG" width="638" height="480"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">The beaches to be found in Italy were admittedly puny.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/sorrento/HPIM0140.JPG" width="638" height="480"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">Pretentious little 5 star hotels sat up high over the water, 
offering what we assume were stunning views.&nbsp; If you try to walk up to see 
what the view is like, a man will stop you, shouting &quot;Privato!&quot; at you until you 
go away.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/sorrento/italy_0003.JPG" width="800" height="131"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">Lots and lots of privato hotels.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/sorrento/IMG_2569.JPG" width="515" height="480"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">This is the most pretentious of all the posh privato palaces.&nbsp; 
Excelsior Vittoria is known for accomodating many celebrities, dignitaries, and 
folk heroes.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/sorrento/IMG_2547.JPG" width="640" height="480"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">We found a few lemon gardens in Sorrento, this one complete 
with a playground.&nbsp; We didn't pass up the opportunity to use the swings, 
although it admittedly felt awkward for me.&nbsp; I was never much of a swinger 
in the playground anyway.&nbsp; See, even typing that felt awkward.&nbsp; Moving 
on...</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/sorrento/IMG_2549.JPG" width="640" height="480"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">The urban part of Sorrento was fun.&nbsp; Bars and 
restaurants, shops, entertainment, boat rides everywhere, and tourists.&nbsp; 
You won't get &quot;authentic Italy&quot; from here, but you'll have a good time.&nbsp; 
Save the authenticity for another stop.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/sorrento/IMG_2551.JPG" width="800" height="600"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">Sorrento's known for its inlaid wood.&nbsp; We went into 
specialty shop and took a picture of some work in progress.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/sorrento/italy_0031.JPG" width="640" height="423"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">We stumbled upon another beautiful grove of lemon trees.&nbsp; They 
wanted you to walk to the end actually.&nbsp; We assumed something neat would be 
down there.&nbsp; I was personally rather thirsty and in the mood for icy 
lemonade.&nbsp; However, all they sold down there was limoncello, which I 
had already bought elsewhere in Sorrento.&nbsp; The path was rustic and peaceful though, 
so we didn't mind the disappointment too much.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/sorrento/italy_0032.JPG" width="640" height="480"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">In the lemon grove, we saw a lady and her bunny on a leash.&nbsp; 
She spoke some English, so I asked her what the name of her bunny was.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/sorrento/italy_0033.JPG" width="640" height="480"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">She told me she named him &quot;Bunny&quot;.&nbsp; I scowled and shook 
my finger menacingly at her, for choosing such a silly, uncreative name, and 
stomped off.&nbsp; Poor Bunny.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/sorrento/IMG_2562.JPG" width="640" height="480"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">If you're not a fan of stairs, you might wish to opt for the 
taxi sometimes.&nbsp; This was on the way to the marina.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/sorrento/IMG_2603.JPG" width="576" height="768"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">Here's the marina.&nbsp; It puzzled Miller how people get to 
their boats, so we watched for a bit and learned what happens.&nbsp; A man at 
the dock takes you in a little boat to your boat, probably earning a shiny coin 
or two in the process.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/sorrento/IMG_2566.JPG" width="640" height="480"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">Gratuitous shot of a befuddled Miller, before we learned this.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/sorrento/IMG_2604.JPG" width="800" height="600"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">I didn't really get away from my love of beer when I was in 
Italy, but I made a concerted effort to sample the Chianti as well, as seen 
here.&nbsp; We met and chatted with these fun vacationers from North Carolina.&nbsp; 
In this picture, I was really just edging towards that nice lady's half-finished 
beer.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/sorrento/sorrento_sunset.jpg" width="640" height="480"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">After a few drinks, I made sure to capture an Italian sunset.&nbsp; 
Miller and I tried many camera settings and angles as the sun set.&nbsp; I think 
this one was the most visually stunning.&nbsp; God bless digital cameras.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/sorrento/italy_0036.JPG" width="679" height="600"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">After a quick trip to Positano and back, we had one more 
dinner in Sorrento.&nbsp; I was overjoyed when some musicians filed in and 
started playing for us.&nbsp; They were so happy.&nbsp; Not as happy as you see 
here.&nbsp; The guy with the accordion was posing.&nbsp; The girl with the 
maracas, however, was not.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/sorrento/bar_ad.jpg" width="236" height="240"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">One more bar trip in Sorrento too.&nbsp; Misleading as it may 
seem, it wasn't the type of bar you are thinking.&nbsp; Stacked on the bar was a
pile of these satirical warnings in the shape of square cards you could keep as a 
souvenir.&nbsp; They had an advertisement for the bar on the back.&nbsp; Yes, the 
bartender was quite attractive.</font></p>
