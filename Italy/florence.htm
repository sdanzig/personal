<p><font size="6">Florence</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font size="4">On the train ride to Florence, Miller was harassed by this 5 
year old little boy who didn't speak a word of English.&nbsp; Miller had to 
repeatedly insist that he didn't speak Italian.&nbsp; You can't see it too well 
in this picture, but here he is running up and down the train with a toy shotgun 
that looked disturbingly large and realistic.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/florence/italy_0402.JPG" width="360" height="480"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">We found our hotel, Hotel Andrea, without too much trouble.&nbsp; 
It was facing a spacious, quiet piazza and was two blocks from the train 
station.&nbsp; 130 euro per night for a double room, and the beds were cozy.&nbsp;
</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/florence/italy_0425.JPG" width="545" height="480"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">Italian TV shows, however, were admittedly disturbing.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/florence/florence_cathedral/inside/italy_0053.JPG" width="800" height="600"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">Florence was a city that was all about art.&nbsp; Just like 
Belgium knew people came for the food, Florence knows what you're here for as 
well.&nbsp; On that note, you can imagine they know how to make their city look 
impressive.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/florence/italy_0404.JPG" width="640" height="480"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">Walking down the streets of Florence, we saw a deluge of tents 
set up, each selling the same types of decorative and practical souvenirs.&nbsp; 
I quickly bored of them.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/florence/italy_0406.JPG" width="360" height="480"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">One thing that did not bore me were the impressive and 
colorful stores that sold masks.&nbsp; Check out this beauty.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/florence/italy_0407.JPG" width="450" height="600"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">Recommended in our tourbook was this restaurant, known for its 
rich display of artwork which coated as much of the walls as possible.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/florence/italy_0411.JPG" width="640" height="480"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">Another piazza in Florence.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/florence/italy_0003.JPG" width="640" height="342"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">There were plenty of museums, most of which have rules against 
cameras.&nbsp; Taking pictures of bird sculptures such as these were highly 
forbidden.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/florence/HPIM0327.JPG" width="514" height="480"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">Yet another dramatic fountain that doesn't hold a candle to 
Rome's Trevi Fountain.&nbsp; I stood in front of it to make sure it felt 
appreciated.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/florence/italy_0005.JPG" width="640" height="480"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">Segway were available for rental.&nbsp; Apparently this group 
decided to tour Florence in style.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/florence/italy_0006.JPG" width="640" height="480"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">The Arnot River, which Miller fervently claimed he waded 
through years ago, is decorated with bridges, that are much safer alternatives 
for transit.&nbsp; The famous bridge in front is lined with little shops.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/florence/italy_0413.JPG" width="640" height="480"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">Here's a shot of an eye-catching bridge.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/florence/HPIM0344.JPG" width="640" height="482"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">Cars scurry across a bridge over the Arnot.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/florence/HPIM0333.JPG" width="361" height="480"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">A random clock tower in Florence.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/florence/italy_0009.JPG" width="640" height="480"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">We went into the Uffizi museum which took 3 hours to get into.&nbsp; 
Just a quick note, the line for people who reserved their tickets in advance 
only had to wait an hour or so.&nbsp; It was worth it though.&nbsp; Works from 
so many artists I've read about were included there.&nbsp; In the museum store, 
I saw this little cookbook that had recipes inspired by foods depicted in works 
of art.&nbsp; I ended up buying this book through Amazon later.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/florence/italy_0011.JPG" width="640" height="480"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">This asphalt surface was actually at a 20-30 degree 
declination.&nbsp; The artsy youth of Florence were scattered about, resting, 
pretending they were on a beach, sorrowfully nonexistent here.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/florence/italy_0012.JPG" width="150" height="240"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">This forbidden picture is of a sculpture of a boy and a little 
dog.&nbsp; We were in a palace south of the Florence Cathedral, just south of 
the Arnot.&nbsp; Quite an impressive collection in that palace, including 
Titian, a famous painter from Venice.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/florence/italy_0013.JPG" width="640" height="400"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">A partially drawn replica of a Bernini sculpture (in Rome) 
decorated a piazza in Florence.&nbsp; It was customary to tip if you take a 
picture, so one of those coins are mine.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/florence/italy_0014.JPG" width="800" height="600"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">I unfortunately entered a &quot;Leonardo Da Vinci&quot; interactive 
museum, where you can play with replicas of his various inventions.&nbsp; Only 
half of them actually functioned, not including the flying machine of course.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/florence/italy_0015.JPG" width="640" height="480"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">Not even the flapping wing was operable.&nbsp; It was bolted 
down at the joint.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/florence/italy_0016.JPG" width="582" height="480"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">Italian choir children singing.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/florence/HPIM0308.JPG" width="638" height="480"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">I found the Arnot was pleasant to walk along, and there was 
even some fishing.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/florence/HPIM0341.JPG" width="640" height="289"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">We found a couple guys who actually caught a massive, 5 foot 
fish.&nbsp; Looks to me like a catfish, but I'm no fish expert.&nbsp; Here you 
see them removing the hook from the fish's mouth, so they can free it.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/florence/italy_0018.JPG" width="547" height="480"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">After pictures were taken and the hook was removed, the two 
sportsmen heaved the thing back into the Arnot.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/florence/italy_0022.JPG" width="800" height="600"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">Here's a shot of the Arnot at night.&nbsp; I think I was 
getting a bit better with my camera over the course of the trip, if I do say so 
myself.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/florence/italy_0023.JPG" width="640" height="480"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">A crowd was gathered around one of the hangouts along the 
Arnot, supposedly next to a British Embassy.&nbsp; As I learned in Rome, embassy 
workers can be a boisterous bunch.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/florence/italy_0056.JPG" width="640" height="480"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">Near the train station was a fortress.&nbsp; Apparently it was 
hosting a cardiology conference at the time.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/florence/italy_0415.JPG" width="167" height="240"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">The scales of justice, held by a random statue in Florence.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/florence/italy_0416.JPG" width="640" height="480"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">Here's a typical street in Florence, decorated with an 
archway.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/florence/italy_0417.JPG" width="360" height="480"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">Baroque architecture reminded me of the Il Gesu church in 
Rome.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/florence/italy_0418.JPG" width="441" height="480"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">Cool horse statue.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/florence/italy_0419.JPG" width="360" height="480"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">You couldn't help but notice that art appreciation was in the 
air.&nbsp; This guy worked some magic with spray paint, creating works of art 
that were selling easily.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/florence/italy_0424.JPG" width="360" height="480"></font><img border="0" src="images/florence/italy_0001.JPG" width="220" height="480"></p>
<p><font size="4">Statue atop their pedestals, some more ornate than others..</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/florence/florence_cathedral/italy_0002.JPG" width="450" height="600"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">The &quot;must see&quot; attraction in Florence, if you see nothing 
else, is the Florence cathedral.&nbsp; Brunelleschi, who designed this, was one 
of the founding fathers of Renaissance architecture.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/florence/HPIM0321.JPG" width="638" height="480"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">Every bit of the cathedral was worthy of awe.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/florence/HPIM0319.JPG" width="452" height="600"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">These magnificent doors were seen near the Cathedral.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/florence/florence_cathedral/inside/italy_0046.JPG" width="360" height="480"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">For 6 euros, you could go in the Florence Cathedral and climb 
up to the top.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/florence/florence_cathedral/inside/italy_0045.JPG" width="640" height="480"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">On the way up, we saw this display of statues.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/florence/florence_cathedral/inside/italy_0047.JPG" width="800" height="600"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">Here's a shot of the ceiling in the cathedral.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/florence/florence_cathedral/inside/italy_0055.JPG" width="320" height="240"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">The stairway up was predictably unsuitable for 
claustrophobics.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/florence/florence_cathedral/inside/italy_0052.JPG" width="800" height="600"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">So when we reached the top, we were rewarded by sweeping views 
of Florence proper.&nbsp; That first picture showing an overview of Florence was 
also taken from here.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/florence/HPIM0388.JPG" width="361" height="480"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">Here's a tower we also saw nearby.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/florence/HPIM0310.JPG" width="638" height="480"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">Although the Florence Cathedral put everything else in 
Florence to shame, they still put plenty of effort into the surrounding 
buildings.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/florence/HPIM0329.JPG" width="623" height="480"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">This proud soldier holds an eternal gaze toward the horizon.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/florence/HPIM0346.JPG" width="638" height="480"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">Smart cars were frequently found throughout Italy.&nbsp; They 
park wherever they want, however they want.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/florence/HPIM0347.JPG" width="283" height="480"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">While I did the bike tour of the Tuscan countryside, Miller 
scouted out the rest of Florence, literally.&nbsp; He was able to treat us to 
some pictures of statues like these that I didn't see for myself.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/florence/HPIM0348.JPG" width="797" height="600"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">The words were unimportant here, as I don't know Italian.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/florence/HPIM0351.JPG" width="638" height="480"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">Not only was so much thought put into the statues, but also 
the layout of magnificent courtyards such as this.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/florence/HPIM0361.JPG" width="638" height="480"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">A painting on a ceiling.&nbsp; What was cool was that the 
floor was painted to look exactly the same.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/florence/HPIM0362.JPG" width="638" height="480"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">Florence certainly captured the spirit of the Renaissance 
wholeheartedly.</font></p>
