<p><font size="4">I signed up with this tour group described thoroughly at &quot;<a href="http://www.ibikeitaly.com">www.ibikeitaly.com</a>&quot;.&nbsp; 
The ad said we'd bike around the Tuscan countryside and stop at a top notch 
restaurant, then tour a local winery.&nbsp; After sampling the wine, we'd 
return.&nbsp; You meet on a bridge over the Arnot River and get on a bus which 
takes you out to a garage 5 minutes outside of Florence.&nbsp; The tour guide, 
in this picture, started out by telling us we were all going to join a work 
camp.&nbsp; Fortunately, he was kidding.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">We were each given a 24 speed bike, helmet, and water bottle.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/tuscany_bike_tour/italy_0005.JPG" width="800" height="600"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">Each bike had a name on a sticker over the front tire.&nbsp; 
Ironically, I got to mount and ride &quot;Jersey Girl&quot;.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/tuscany_bike_tour/italy_0008.JPG" width="640" height="480"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">We headed out into the countryside and saw these olive trees 
in the distance.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/tuscany_bike_tour/italy_0014.JPG" width="640" height="480"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">We parked our bikes briefly, to visit a 14th century 
monastery.&nbsp; I snapped a picture of this view on the way up.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/tuscany_bike_tour/italy_0013.JPG" width="640" height="480"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">The Florence cityscape was fully visible from the monastery.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/tuscany_bike_tour/italy_0015.JPG" width="360" height="480"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">In the monastery's courtyard there was a little pond with 
fish.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/tuscany_bike_tour/italy_0016.JPG" width="372" height="480"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">We saw this plaque mentioning the mother of someone you might 
know.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/tuscany_bike_tour/italy_0017.JPG" width="800" height="600"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">The monastery had a spiffy little museum with ornate 
artifacts.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/tuscany_bike_tour/italy_0018.JPG" width="640" height="480"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">I was surprised to see this mummy included in the modest 
collection.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/tuscany_bike_tour/italy_0019.JPG" width="640" height="480"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">Here's the Italian description attached to the mummy if you'd 
care to translate.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/tuscany_bike_tour/italy_0020.JPG" width="640" height="480"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">A monastery will have, of course, a place of worship.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/tuscany_bike_tour/italy_0022.JPG" width="610" height="480"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">We also stopped at this small little church later on.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/tuscany_bike_tour/italy_0024.JPG" width="640" height="480"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">More sweeping views along the way to the restaurant.&nbsp; I 
was extremely hungry by then.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/tuscany_bike_tour/italy_0029.JPG" width="640" height="480"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">Here's the restaurant we stopped in.&nbsp; The food was really 
good, although I didn't eat as much as I'd have liked.&nbsp; They passed around 
various foods on plates.&nbsp; I kept anticipating a much bigger dish afterward.&nbsp; 
Eventually the &quot;appetizers&quot; stopped, and I had to scrounge for what was left 
over.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/tuscany_bike_tour/italy_0026.JPG" width="800" height="600"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">Here's where we comfortably waited as they set up the tables.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/tuscany_bike_tour/italy_0030.JPG" width="640" height="480"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">Here's where the local winery sold its wine.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/tuscany_bike_tour/italy_0031.JPG" width="289" height="480"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">Diego the dog was free to roam the winery.&nbsp; He didn't 
even have to entertain the customers, but he did anyway.&nbsp; When it rained, 
he suddenly vanished.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/tuscany_bike_tour/italy_0032.JPG" width="360" height="480"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">Lots of equipment for fermenting, storing, and bottling wine 
was found around the winery.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/tuscany_bike_tour/italy_0033.JPG" width="360" height="480"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">This part of the winery was the perfect home for countless 
daddy long leg spiders.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/tuscany_bike_tour/italy_0034.JPG" width="640" height="480"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">Wine was stored in these barrels.&nbsp; Atop one barrel you 
see a thing sticking out the top.&nbsp; That's a fermentation lock, which lets 
the gas escape the wine as it ferments, but does not let any air back in.&nbsp; 
I know this because making wine has similarities to brewing beer, one of my 
pastimes.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/tuscany_bike_tour/italy_0035.JPG" width="459" height="480"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">They produce olive oil at this winery too.&nbsp; Here's the 
room where olive oil is stored in terracotta containers.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/tuscany_bike_tour/italy_0036.JPG" width="640" height="480"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">Some random vegetables were grown at this winery.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/tuscany_bike_tour/italy_0037.JPG" width="640" height="480"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">Here are some of their olive trees.&nbsp; I followed other 
bikers out here, but left when I realized they just wanted to make out in 
private.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/tuscany_bike_tour/italy_0038.JPG" width="640" height="480"><img border="0" src="images/tuscany_bike_tour/italy_0039.JPG" width="640" height="480"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">This is the view from across the street from the winery.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/tuscany_bike_tour/italy_0040.JPG" width="640" height="480"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">Here's a sign with the name of the winery.&nbsp; You can see 
they're advertising Chianti wine, which apparently is wine made from the 
Sangiovese grape.&nbsp; The wine has to come from a certain region and meet a 
certain quality standard to be given permission to be called &quot;Chianti&quot; wine.&nbsp; 
Even more exacting restrictions exist for Chianti Reserved.&nbsp; This all could 
have just been a sales pitch though.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/tuscany_bike_tour/italy_0041.JPG" width="609" height="480"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">We went up and downhill often, and my bike's gears screwed up 
3 times.&nbsp; The seats were extremely painful to sit on.&nbsp; I continued to 
feel the pain for a week afterward.&nbsp; I did scold them about it, but if you 
decide to do this tour, make sure they describe what the bike seat will be like.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/tuscany_bike_tour/italy_0042.JPG" width="495" height="480"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">While waiting for the other bikers to arrive, I took a picture 
of this lizard.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/tuscany_bike_tour/italy_0043.JPG" width="195" height="480"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">Here's the one guy who wiped out during the tour.&nbsp; He's 
posing in a way so that you can see all of his injuries.&nbsp; Just at the end, 
you go downhill the rest of the way.&nbsp; Your bike can go very fast without 
pedaling, and turning can be rather perilous as well.&nbsp; That is where this 
guy fell.</font></p>
