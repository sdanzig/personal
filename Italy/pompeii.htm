<p><font size="6">Pompeii</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/pompeii/IMG_2607.JPG" width="320" height="240"><img border="0" src="images/pompeii/IMG_2609.JPG" width="262" height="240"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">Lots of ruins surrounded us in Pompeii.&nbsp; Don't ask me to 
identify any of them.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/pompeii/IMG_2611.JPG" width="640" height="480"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">Mount Vesuvius seemed to follow us around wherever we went 
while we were in Pompeii.&nbsp; You'd think the people of Pompeii would have 
taken a hint, but they didn't -- at least not until 79AD.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/pompeii/IMG_2613.JPG" width="320" height="227"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">More ruins.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/pompeii/HPIM0166.JPG" width="638" height="480"></p>
<p><font size="4">As we were gawking at the impressive ruins, we felt a presence 
behind us and turned around.&nbsp; There was Mt. Vesuvius still following us.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/pompeii/IMG_2615.JPG" width="450" height="600"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">We went indoors to try to hide from Vesuvius.&nbsp; Walls were 
decorated with partially restored ancient decorations.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/pompeii/IMG_2644.JPG" width="640" height="480"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">The vegetation the citizens of Pompeii grew still occupy some 
of the grassy fields.&nbsp; These certainly included lemon trees.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/pompeii/IMG_2621.JPG" width="640" height="480"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">This served as a stage for the Rolling Stones in ancient Rome.&nbsp; 
They're that old.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/pompeii/IMG_2622.JPG" width="360" height="480"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">A great courtyard for the potato sack races.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/pompeii/IMG_2624.JPG" width="629" height="480"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">Pompeii was a dog town.&nbsp; Let me tell you, these stray 
dogs were everywhere, perfectly healthy and happy.&nbsp; We saw no food, so it's 
a mystery as to where these canines chowed down.&nbsp; I caught this dude in a 
picture as he trotted by.&nbsp; Note the position of the ears.&nbsp; Anyone who 
knows about dogs can tell that the dog was not about to rabidly leap at me.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/pompeii/IMG_2625.JPG" width="640" height="480"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">Try to find Miller, camouflaged in the ruins.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/pompeii/IMG_2627.JPG" width="360" height="480"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">Be grateful for the comfort of plastic seating next time you 
go to a stadium and complain.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/pompeii/IMG_2628.JPG" width="640" height="392"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">Citizens of ancient Pompeii lined the streets long ago.&nbsp; 
Now, Pompeii is populated with just as many people, but they're all tourists.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/pompeii/IMG_2629.JPG" width="275" height="240"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">And dogs.&nbsp; This one found a shady spot and no doubt 
wanted peace and quiet.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/pompeii/IMG_2635.JPG" width="640" height="480"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">More ancient decorations unearthed on the ceilings of 
Pompeii's buildings.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/pompeii/IMG_2645.JPG" width="640" height="480"><img border="0" src="images/pompeii/IMG_2647.JPG" width="640" height="480"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">The citizens of Pompeii were encased in volcanic ash, their 
eternal poses preserved as they rotted away.&nbsp; Archaeologists later filled 
these ash encasements with plaster, recreating ancient trauma.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/pompeii/IMG_2633.JPG" width="320" height="164"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">It really stinks when volcanic ash prevents you from reaching 
the toilet.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/pompeii/IMG_2634.JPG" width="640" height="480"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">I believe these little piles served as heat sinks.&nbsp; 
Normally I see them around bathhouses, so that's probably what these were for.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/pompeii/IMG_2637.JPG" width="450" height="600"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">Much of Pompeii's artwork was sent off to museums around the 
world.&nbsp; All that remains in Pompeii are giant stickers on black plastic 
slates somewhat replicating what was there.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/pompeii/IMG_2639.JPG" width="360" height="480"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">Many works of art remain, however, and often are protected by 
plastic sheathes, as shown.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/pompeii/IMG_2640.JPG" width="640" height="480"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">Another dog, completely tame, just sitting there chilling out 
as you pass by.&nbsp; It's possible every so often he eats a small child, which 
would explain a lot.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/pompeii/HPIM0190.JPG" width="638" height="480"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">Here was the obvious money-shot we found along the way.&nbsp; 
We were at a walkway that seemed made for taking this picture.&nbsp; In fact, 
there were signs saying &quot;Scenic view&quot;, &quot;Take picture here&quot;, &quot;Instant post card&quot;.&nbsp; 
Keep in mind, Mt. Vesuvius is still following us.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/pompeii/IMG_2651.JPG" width="640" height="480"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">Brainzzzzz....</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/pompeii/HPIM0196.JPG" width="592" height="480"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">Okay, I'm a dorky zombie.&nbsp; I'll still eat your brains, 
dammit.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/pompeii/IMG_2657.JPG" width="360" height="480"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">More restored painted walls.&nbsp; Pompeii residents oft 
seemed to prefer simple, small decorations that floated on spacious white walls.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/pompeii/IMG_2659.JPG" width="800" height="600"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">This is actually a mind-bogglingly intricate mosaic.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/pompeii/HPIM0156.JPG" width="638" height="480"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">The shade from the ancient ruins sharply contrasted with the 
sunny courtyards and grass fields.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/pompeii/HPIM0159.JPG" width="638" height="480"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">More ruins, decorated with terracotta jugs.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/pompeii/HPIM0186.JPG" width="638" height="480"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">Bronze statues of angry little animals decorated these ruins.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/pompeii/HPIM0188.JPG" width="638" height="480"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">During this picture, I no doubt was realizing how much my feet 
hurt.&nbsp; Pompeii was big.&nbsp; It took a while to reach the other side of 
Pompeii, where we saw fairly modern buildings, perhaps belonging to the dogs' 
caretakers.&nbsp; Who knows.&nbsp; After Pompeii, we made an on-the-fly decision 
to try visiting Mt. Vesuvius.</font></p>
