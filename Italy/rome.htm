<p><font size="6">Rome</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/rome/IMG_2296.JPG" width="640" height="480"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">Here's where it all started.&nbsp; Got off the connecting 
flight from Lisbon (Air Portugal did not treat me well) and took the Da Vinci 
Express right into Rome.&nbsp; This is what an Italian train station looks like!</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/rome/IMG_2299.JPG" width="381" height="480"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">After I checked into the hostel, I ventured out to the 
Colosseum.&nbsp; This is not it, but it's still pretty.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/rome/IMG_2300.JPG" width="640" height="480"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">And here's the Colosseum!&nbsp; Let's move in closer.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/rome/HPIM0076.JPG" width="638" height="480"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">Here's me in front of the Colosseum!</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/rome/IMG_2302.JPG" width="493" height="480"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">Centurions were posted around the Colosseum, mainly for photo 
ops, but this one was annoyed by me, busy with his cell phone.&nbsp; At least he 
isn't a cell phone chariot driver.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/rome/roman_on_cell.jpg" width="172" height="240"></p>
<p><font size="4">Here's a close-up.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/rome/IMG_2319.JPG" width="640" height="480"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">Here's where I first saw Palatine Hill, where supposedly Rome 
was founded.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/rome/IMG_2315.JPG" width="640" height="480"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">You can skip the line to get into the Colosseum if you pay for 
a tour.&nbsp; I don't know if it was worth it.&nbsp; The lady with the pink hat 
is the tour guide.&nbsp; She asked if anyone was Jewish and, being raised 
Jewish, I was the only one to raise my hand.&nbsp; So then she beamed and got 
all happy that a Jew was in the group, and explained about Jewish slaves and how 
the Romans mistreated them, etc etc.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/rome/IMG_2316.JPG" width="800" height="583"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">Here's dramatic footage... the inside of the Colosseum.&nbsp; 
Note the floor is missing.&nbsp; It was news to me.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/rome/IMG_2322.JPG" width="360" height="480"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">A cool thing is, the walls of the Colosseum are not quite 
complete anymore.&nbsp; They have a nice cross section of the three layers of 
the Colosseum.&nbsp; You can see the line enters between the outer and middle 
walls.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/rome/HPIM0077.JPG" width="361" height="480"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">Rome has three &quot;Arch of Triumphs&quot;, and here's one of them, the 
Arch of Constantine.&nbsp; That's my vacation buddy, Miller, in front of it.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/rome/HPIM0081.JPG" width="638" height="480"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">Here's the second arch.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/rome/HPIM0088.JPG" width="361" height="480"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">Close-up of it.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/rome/HPIM0084.JPG" width="638" height="480"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">Here's a nice shot of freshly sprouted pillars growing near 
the Colosseum.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/rome/IMG_2497.JPG" width="360" height="480"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">A ruined temple along the way to the Roman Forum, near 
Palatine Hill.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/rome/IMG_2498.JPG" width="640" height="480"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">Fenced off ruins.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/rome/IMG_2499.JPG" width="640" height="453"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">Behond more ruins.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/rome/IMG_2500.JPG" width="640" height="450"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">I think this was the second arch again.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/rome/IMG_2327.JPG" width="640" height="400"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">I wandered a bit aimlessly during my first day in Rome.&nbsp; 
I stumbled upon a javelin-throwing practice session.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/rome/IMG_2323.JPG" width="452" height="480"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">Next I visited a huge random Roman structure that used to be 
for bathing.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/rome/IMG_2330.JPG" width="640" height="480"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">This is the ancient mosaic that made up part of the floor 
Romans used to walk on to bathe.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/rome/IMG_2331.JPG" width="640" height="455"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">Random tour group wandering through these ruins.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/rome/IMG_2335.JPG" width="558" height="480"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">This is another intricate mosaic that decorated the walls of 
the structure.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/rome/IMG_2341.JPG" width="640" height="302"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">As I wandered away, I was besieged by a mad rush of cyclists.&nbsp; 
Apparently they were advocating &quot;Critical Mass&quot; of bicycle usage throughout the 
world.&nbsp; They seemed cheerful and comical, honking their horns, waving, 
playing simple yet happy-sounding music.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/rome/IMG_2340.JPG" width="320" height="168"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">Yes, I actually meant they were playing music.&nbsp; Fuzzy 
picture, but on the left, you can see a bunch of people on a multi-person bike, 
each playing a different instrument.&nbsp; There's a drum in front, for 
instance.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/rome/IMG_2347.JPG" width="589" height="480"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">I saw a neat looking bike in one of the shops I walked past.&nbsp; 
Motorcycles are huge in Italy.&nbsp; However, none of them look like this.&nbsp; 
They're all &quot;Vespas&quot;, which have these huge windshields that emulate riot gear.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/rome/IMG_2352.JPG" width="800" height="600"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">Here's the famous Trevi Fountain when I saw it at night.&nbsp; 
It was absolutely stunning.&nbsp; They say if you turn around and throw a coin 
over your shoulder into the fountain, you'll return to Rome.&nbsp; I did, so I 
guess a bunch of Romans will kidnap me at some point.&nbsp; Rome was a nice 
city, and I might go back, but I've got many more places to go to first.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/rome/HPIM0107.JPG" width="638" height="480"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">Here's Trevi Fountain during the day.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/rome/IMG_2353.JPG" width="408" height="480"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">More random ancient ruins.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/rome/IMG_2354.JPG" width="640" height="329"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">I'm not the one to remember the story behind these.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/rome/IMG_2355.JPG" width="632" height="480"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">Or these.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/rome/IMG_2357.JPG" width="640" height="480"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">Here's the third arch.&nbsp; It's the most difficult to find, 
but it's still a hulking mass of stone, so it wasn't really hidden, even in 
Rome.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/rome/IMG_2360.JPG" width="640" height="480"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">I found the Tiber River.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/rome/IMG_2361.JPG" width="320" height="234"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">There were little dips like this one in the river here n' 
there, man-made of course.&nbsp; This was odd, however, as buoyant trash seemed 
trapped in front of one.&nbsp; If you look closely like I did, you'd see there 
was 6 soccer balls out there!</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/rome/vatican/IMG_2362.JPG" width="640" height="480"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">In the distance, I finally caught sight of the Vatican in the 
distance.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/rome/vatican/IMG_2366.JPG" width="640" height="376"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">It took me longer to get there than I'd admit, but here I was, 
facing St. Peter's Cathedral.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/rome/vatican/IMG_2367.JPG" width="640" height="433"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">The line to get in was quite long, and everyone was cutting 
near the front.&nbsp; No one spoke the same language, so we didn't know how to 
tell them to stop it.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/rome/vatican/IMG_2368.JPG" width="80" height="120"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">Colorful guards were posted throughout the Vatican.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/rome/vatican/IMG_2369.JPG" width="640" height="480"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">If I was a Pope, this would be what I'd see as I address my 
followers.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/rome/vatican/IMG_2370.JPG" width="450" height="600"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">Lots of white and gold decorates the walls and ceilings of St. 
Peter's.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/rome/vatican/IMG_2371.JPG" width="320" height="240"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">Lighting bad.&nbsp; Best pictures I could muster.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/rome/vatican/IMG_2372.JPG" width="320" height="240"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">Just know that it looked impressive.&nbsp; Michelangelo saw to 
that.&nbsp; The famous ceiling he painted, in the Sistine Chapel, is separate 
from St. Peters though, so you're not missing that.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/rome/vatican/IMG_2373.JPG" width="505" height="480"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">Here's a procession of Vatican holymen.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/rome/vatican/stylistic_priests.jpg" width="640" height="429"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">This picture of Vatican holymen didn't come out as expected, 
but it looks stylish.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/rome/vatican/IMG_2375.JPG" width="180" height="240"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">Here's a flashy dome you see as you look up in St. Peter's.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/rome/vatican/IMG_2377.JPG" width="249" height="240"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">Statues decorate St. Peter's, aiding silent meditation.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/rome/vatican/IMG_2382.JPG" width="360" height="480"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">So after a relatively quick hour's wait to get into the 
Vatican Museum, the fun began.&nbsp; See the statue &quot;Apollo Belvedere&quot;, in all 
its glory.&nbsp; Greeks were masters at sculpting the human body, along with 
drapery.&nbsp; This is a Roman copy of the original bronze statue which is 
forever lost.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/rome/vatican/IMG_2384.JPG" width="800" height="600"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">Lots more famous relics are shown off in the Vatican Museum.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/rome/vatican/IMG_2385.JPG" width="450" height="600"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">I kept looking up, wondering if I was in the Sistine Chapel 
yet.&nbsp; Sign after sign led me through these beautiful ceilings painted by 
someone other than Michelangelo.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/rome/vatican/IMG_2387.JPG" width="640" height="480"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">Another decorative room with a massive punch bowl.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/rome/vatican/IMG_2389.JPG" width="360" height="480"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">An impressive dome we passed through on the way to the Sistine 
Chapel.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/rome/vatican/IMG_2390.JPG" width="331" height="480"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">Discobolos, also a replica of a lost statue.&nbsp; Apparently 
this is NOT the way to throw a discus though.&nbsp; It's been tested and 
confirmed, after many athletes studied this statue and have tried.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/rome/vatican/IMG_2393.JPG" width="607" height="600"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">This is the hall of maps.&nbsp; You can imagine how impressed 
I was with this hallway, but no, this wasn't the Sistine Chapel either.&nbsp; 
Absolutely stunning though, although not a very convenient tourist guide.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/rome/vatican/IMG_2395.JPG" width="800" height="600"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">A painting in the Vatican museum that turned out very 
yellowish when tried to brighten it.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/rome/vatican/IMG_2396.JPG" width="800" height="600"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">Another stunningly painted ceiling on the way.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/rome/vatican/IMG_2397.JPG" width="800" height="600"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">We reached rooms containing famous frescos painted by Raphael.&nbsp; 
I forget which were painted by him and which were painted by his acolytes, but 
they're all impressive.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/rome/vatican/IMG_2398.JPG" width="360" height="480"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">Here's another.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/rome/vatican/IMG_2399.JPG" width="800" height="600"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">And another.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/rome/vatican/IMG_2400.JPG" width="360" height="480"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">Here's a parody of a Diego Velazquez painting I was looking 
for but never found.&nbsp; The Vatican had all sorts of artwork to show off.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/rome/vatican/IMG_2401.JPG" width="517" height="480"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">Here's another sign saying &quot;SISTINE CHAPEL, THATAWAY!&quot;.&nbsp; 
I must've been following these signs for at least a mile, indoors, waiting 
behind lots of other people looking for the same signs.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/rome/vatican/IMG_2402.JPG" width="640" height="480"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">Finally!&nbsp; This is the famous ceiling.&nbsp; Routinely, 
the curators were hushing the crowd and chanting &quot;NO PHOTO&quot;.&nbsp; Camera 
flashes were going off like crazy anyway.&nbsp; I took mine without a flash and 
it came out pretty well.&nbsp; You can see in the middle, the famous &quot;finger 
touch&quot; that you see in some art-print stores and college dorm-room posters.&nbsp; 
On the right is god and his angels, and on the left is man.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/rome/vatican/IMG_2403.JPG" width="640" height="480"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">Various papal equipment on display.&nbsp; The papal pie scoop 
made me hungry.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/rome/vatican/IMG_2404.JPG" width="360" height="480"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">I thought this spiral staircase we followed on the way out 
looked interesting... fancy yet much more subtle than everything else in the 
Vatican museum.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/rome/IMG_2407.JPG" width="640" height="413"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">Here's a nice big castle I spotted near the Vatican.&nbsp; It 
gives you a pretty good panoramic view of Rome.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/rome/IMG_2408.JPG" width="180" height="240"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">This person was pretending to be the Statue of Liberty outside 
the castle.&nbsp; Pay money and he moves or something.&nbsp; The problem is, 
these guys are not very talented, fidgeting and blinking constantly.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/rome/IMG_2414.JPG" width="640" height="480"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">I went into the castle and saw lots of artwork which I wasn't 
allowed to take pictures of.&nbsp; This was a courtyard inside the castle.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/rome/IMG_2423.JPG" width="640" height="480"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">Going up the castle, there was, of course, the opportunity to 
look down.&nbsp; I was gleeful to see piles of cannonballs lining some of the 
castle walls.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/rome/IMG_2424.JPG" width="640" height="320"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">Here's a view of the Vatican from the castle.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/rome/IMG_2427.JPG" width="377" height="480"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">A cool statue perched in the castle.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/rome/IMG_2430.JPG" width="640" height="288"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">Another view from the castle, overlooking Rome.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/rome/IMG_2431.JPG" width="640" height="296"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">And another view.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/rome/IMG_2434.JPG" width="800" height="600"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">The castle had a cool outline of all the buildings you saw in 
the panoramic view, with text labeling each, so you knew what you were looking 
at.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/rome/IMG_2441.JPG" width="640" height="450"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">This was my first view of Piazza Navona.&nbsp; Just some chic 
hangout in Rome.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/rome/IMG_2439.JPG" width="365" height="600"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">Rome had many of these obelisks decorated with ancient 
hieroglyphs throughout.&nbsp; This is one belonging to a fountain under 
construction in Piazza Navona.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/rome/IMG_2440.JPG" width="180" height="240"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">Here's a famous Baroque church in Piazza Navona.&nbsp; It was 
famous because of its pioneering architecture.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/rome/IMG_2471.JPG" width="335" height="480"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">And here's going inside.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/rome/IMG_2472.JPG" width="576" height="768"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">It was popular to portray the dome of a cathedral opening up 
into heaven.&nbsp; The painting is intricate, but more importantly, stunning.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/rome/IMG_2473.JPG" width="360" height="480"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">The statues in there were eye-catching as well.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font size="4">Finally we reached the Spanish Steps of Rome.&nbsp; It's 
admired as a beautiful marvel of architecture.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/rome/IMG_2532.JPG" width="640" height="480"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">Miller was here, 2007.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/rome/IMG_2445.JPG" width="450" height="600"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">Here's a view from the top of the Spanish steps.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/rome/IMG_2461.JPG" width="624" height="480"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">This was a house, currently under restoration, near the top of 
the Spanish Steps, that I read about beforehand.&nbsp; It's an example of the 
rather humorous Mannerist architecture that succeeded Michelangelo and Raphael.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/rome/IMG_2450.JPG" width="512" height="768"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">This is Trajan's Column, standing in a Roman piazza, depicting 
stories of Trajan's victories in war.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/rome/IMG_2451.JPG" width="640" height="480"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">This is the Pantheon which includes a basilica that houses the 
remains of Raphael (the painter).</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/rome/IMG_2452.JPG" width="320" height="240"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">Here's inside the basilica.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/rome/IMG_2455.JPG" width="267" height="480"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">Here's the statue above Raphael's remains.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/rome/IMG_2456.JPG" width="320" height="240"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">And behind this glass is Raphael himself.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/rome/IMG_2458.JPG" width="640" height="480"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">A museum along the way had an exhibit with photos of memorable 
Roman scenes.&nbsp; They were fascinating, and not surprisingly, they included 
Italy's recent soccer World Cup win.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/rome/IMG_2462.JPG" width="517" height="600"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">This is the Tritone Fountain, which pales in comparison to the 
Trevi Fountain, but still looks pretty cool.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/rome/IMG_2463.JPG" width="640" height="462"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">Another stylish building in Rome.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/rome/IMG_2467.JPG" width="609" height="480"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">I think this is some military regiment trotting off somewhere.&nbsp;
</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/rome/IMG_2469.JPG" width="640" height="480"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">I found a museum which displayed four crypts constructed of 
actual human remains.&nbsp; I snuck this picture while I was there.&nbsp; There 
was also a wall covered with pelvic bones.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/rome/crypt.jpg" width="800" height="530"></p>
<p><font size="4">Here's a scan of the postcard I bought from the museum.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/rome/IMG_2475.JPG" width="544" height="480"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">I had to hunt around for a while to find Il Gesu, another 
pioneering church in Rome.&nbsp; This is supposedly the grand-daddy of Baroque 
architecture, however.&nbsp; The scrolls on the sides joining the two stories 
were something new, along with the double pilasters.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/rome/IMG_2478.JPG" width="1024" height="768"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">Inside Il Gesu was another intricately painted ceiling, 
including another dome leading to heaven.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/rome/IMG_2479.JPG" width="640" height="480"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">A lot of structures in Rome will be covered up like this.&nbsp; 
Some have a picture on the cover, and some covers are made of a see-through 
material.&nbsp; This was just ugly.&nbsp; However, the rest of it was very 
picture-worthy.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/rome/IMG_2480.JPG" width="360" height="480"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">I found a wax museum in Rome!&nbsp; And of course we see the 
powerful Fuhrer molded in earwax.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/rome/IMG_2482.JPG" width="640" height="480"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">Here's a pope and his posse.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/rome/IMG_2483.JPG" width="598" height="480"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">Badass executioner, at your service.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/rome/IMG_2484.JPG" width="640" height="480"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">Here's Da Vinci painting the Mona Lisa!&nbsp; Lisa was the 
sitter's first name.&nbsp; Her last name was Gherardini.&nbsp; She was the wife 
of a wealthy businessman, Wikipedia tells me.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/rome/IMG_2486.JPG" width="320" height="240"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">A random piazza in Rome after a light drizzling.&nbsp; The 
weather was, for the most part, very nice in Italy.&nbsp; I still had to buy an 
umbrella along the way.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/rome/IMG_2487.JPG" width="640" height="457"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">Here's another museum in Rome, closed as usual.&nbsp; Museums 
in general don't like being accessible by the public, so they close at 
inexplicably early hours.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/rome/IMG_2488.JPG" width="596" height="600"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">Here's inside another church.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/rome/IMG_2490.JPG" width="360" height="480"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">And I found this statue in there, along with other statues of 
the rest of the saints.&nbsp; This was my favorite saint statue though.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/rome/IMG_2502.JPG" width="640" height="480"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">Night fell and I stumbled into an Irish pub.&nbsp; Apparently 
it was filled with US Embassy guys having a &quot;trivia&quot; contest.&nbsp; Top prize 
was 500 euros.&nbsp; I was amused and, after they heard I was interested, they 
handed me over to a random team.&nbsp; Here was some of the puzzles we had to 
solve.&nbsp; They already solved the easy ones though.&nbsp; I was able to help 
with some answers which included Orson Welles, Madonna, and Estonia.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/rome/IMG_2503.JPG" width="640" height="480"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">Here's a shot of my geeky companions.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/rome/IMG_2504.JPG" width="640" height="480"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">We didn't win... not even close, but they claimed to have done 
better than usual.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/rome/IMG_2505.JPG" width="536" height="715"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">I made a point of visiting the National Museum of Rome.&nbsp; 
They had some fascinating exhibits, such as this 5th century BC armor.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/rome/IMG_2507.JPG" width="526" height="480"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">Another intricately carved exhibit.&nbsp; See the hungry lion.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/rome/IMG_2508.JPG" width="669" height="1084"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">There was a section of the museum devoted to inscriptions.&nbsp; 
I found some that related to Judaism, just because it's my heritage.&nbsp; This 
one was supposedly in memory of a man who dealt with problems that arose amongst 
the Jews.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/rome/IMG_2509.JPG" width="509" height="480"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">This guy apparently ran a synagogue.&nbsp; See the menorah.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/rome/IMG_2510.JPG" width="640" height="476"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">Another menorah to be found.&nbsp; I don't think I zoomed in 
enough to read the description of this, but the creepy faces caught my 
attention.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/rome/IMG_2512.JPG" width="800" height="600"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">Good luck to reading this, but this section of the museum was 
devoted to the rise of mankind.&nbsp; I thought these containers looked 
interesting.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/rome/IMG_2513.JPG" width="223" height="480"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">The museum had a courtyard lined with mostly headless statues.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/rome/IMG_2516.JPG" width="640" height="480"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">Here's a view of the courtyard, complete with rain-soaked 
ancient relics.&nbsp; For Rome, restoration is big business, which I think is 
part of the reason they don't weather-seal everything.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/rome/IMG_2517.JPG" width="640" height="480"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">In the museum's gift shop, I saw a cat sitting peacefully on 
the floor, and took his picture.&nbsp; Rome is a feline city, which you'll see 
later.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/rome/IMG_2518.JPG" width="165" height="240"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">After the hostel, we made it to a hotel.&nbsp; The hotels were 
quite spacious, and mostly affordable at an average of 200 US dollars a night.&nbsp; 
The beds were for the most part rather hard though.&nbsp; As a tip, ask for 
extra pillows and put them under or between your legs when you sleep.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/rome/IMG_2522.JPG" width="640" height="480"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">They advertised this small prison where supposedly Julius 
Caesar was held.&nbsp; It wasn't very impressive, but here's a picture.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/rome/HPIM0093.JPG" width="638" height="480"></p>
<p><font size="4">And another. Miller thought the upside-down cross was 
interesting.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/rome/IMG_2524.JPG" width="640" height="480"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">Now what's odd about these ruins you might ask?&nbsp; Let's 
look closely.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/rome/IMG_2525.JPG" width="640" height="480"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">There's a cat!</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/rome/HPIM0100.JPG" width="493" height="480"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">And another!</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/rome/HPIM0101.JPG" width="638" height="480"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">Try and count the cats in this picture.&nbsp; Apparently this 
latest batch of ruins was a &quot;cat sanctuary&quot;.&nbsp; 450 cats all taken care of 
with Roman tax dollars.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/rome/IMG_2528.JPG" width="640" height="480"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">They're cute though.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/rome/IMG_2527.JPG" width="523" height="480"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">Here is an angry sign that begs for information to apprehend 
the criminal who dragged this cat &quot;away violently with a noose around her neck&quot;.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/rome/IMG_2529.JPG" width="276" height="480"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">This poor elephant was impaled by one of those 
formerly-mentioned hieroglyphic obelisks.&nbsp; Seeing this warning, we knew it 
was time to leave Rome.</font></p>
