<p><font size="4">More beautiful scenery along the Amalfi coast as we headed by 
boat to Positano.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Here's what I think was the island of Capri, which we heard 
was a total rip-off for susceptible tourists, so I skipped it.&nbsp; Might've 
been nice though, so you might want to go if you have some spare cash.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Wonderful little towers dotted the landscapes we floated past.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Little houses and shops populated the coast.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">

<p><font size="4">Positano is known for its stairs and inclines.&nbsp; If you 
want to see all the shops, you had better not be shy of a bit of uphill walking.&nbsp; 
It wasn't too bad, and even if you don't want the workout, there are taxis, and 
plenty of little shops within easy reach of the coast.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">From this view you can see the beach pretty well, although let 
me be frank.&nbsp; Walking on a beach consisting of tiny pebbles rather than 
sand kind of hurts.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font size="4">For instance, Miller is feeling pain right here, walking on 
the beach with his bare feet.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Positano is a beautiful little town though.&nbsp; Isn't this 
flowery walkway charming?</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/positano/HPIM0300.JPG" width="638" height="480"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">Along the way, we noticed something pretty cool.&nbsp; They 
carved little facades with doors and windows into the rock.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/positano/big_dog.JPG" width="640" height="480"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">In Positano, there were a bunch of locals playing with a 
rather large dog.&nbsp; This picture doesn't do the dog justice.&nbsp; It looked 
like it could take down a bear.&nbsp; However, it was content to be the monkey 
in the middle instead.&nbsp; With the way it was plowing through the children to 
get to the ball, every so often leaping rather high, it would have made a potent 
NFL runningback.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">

<p><font size="4">Here's me at a little restaurant along the way.&nbsp; It 
wasn't so straightforward to find a restaurant in Positano with a water view, 
surprisingly.&nbsp; I think the hotels claimed most of them.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">While waiting to leave, we witnessed this fun little practice 
session for a fashion show.&nbsp; Just so you know, Positano is known for its 
trendy fashion.&nbsp; The shirts were expensive here, but those same exact 
shirts are more expensive in the states.&nbsp; For instance, I remember seeing a 
Tommy Bahama shirt that looked like a pajama top in Nordstroms for 175 US 
dollars.&nbsp; A shirt that looked exactly the same in Positano went for about 
60 euros, which is roughly 80 USD.&nbsp; An amusing anecdote was when a tourist 
walked down the steps unsuspectingly, and everyone started cheering for him.&nbsp; 
As the guy realized what was going on, he started swaying his hips and 
gracefully spun and took a bow.&nbsp; The cheers turned to applause.</font></p>
