<p><font size="4">Spaghetti carbonara, in Rome.&nbsp; There's bacon and egg in 
there.&nbsp; It's really good and hearty!&nbsp; I recommend this for a first 
lunch or dinner after make the long flight out to Italy.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font size="4">Italy used to have really bad pizza, but now every restaurant 
in Italy sells it.&nbsp; It's actually gotten somewhat close to our New York 
pizza, except that they sell pizza by weight, and in this case, served it to me 
like a sandwich.&nbsp; I'll be honest, I'm more of a beer person than a wine 
person, but I appreciate wine too.&nbsp; Wine doesn't really go with pizza 
though, and when I'm thirsty, I normally reach for the beer first.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Just outside the Vatican was a nice little restaurant I 
ordered Ossabuca from, which translates to &quot;Bone marrow&quot;.&nbsp; I admittedly 
didn't know you were supposed to scoop out the marrow, but that was only a tiny 
part of the dish.&nbsp; Under that sauce was a lot of very tender meat that 
really hit the spot.&nbsp; I recommend it!&nbsp; In the back, I think there was 
some lamb on those sticks.&nbsp; I made a habit of ordering two entrees per 
dinner when the menu looked good.&nbsp; Oh, and that beer in the back is not 
Italian.&nbsp; This place served my favorite German beer, Paulaner, and after a 
hard day's touring of the Vatican, it was very needed.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">The hostel I stayed at had free internet access.&nbsp; While I 
typed away, I munched on this panini.&nbsp; I think that's prosciutto in there.&nbsp; 
I'm not going to remember details on a lot of this food, honestly.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">A very hearty baked potato paired with a potatoey soup.&nbsp; 
I ate what looked interesting.&nbsp; I'm sure my diet, when totaled, would be 
balanced.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font size="4">The grilled squid on the right was something different for me.&nbsp; 
I normally see it chopped up until rings and tentacles.&nbsp; This was really 
good though.&nbsp; Also, check out that salad in front.&nbsp; I really like the 
large parmesan slices, even though they make the salad a bit harder to eat.&nbsp; 
With the cherry tomato halves, it was a very classy-looking salad, until I ate 
it.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">See?&nbsp; I drank wine.&nbsp; Miller showed up and had to get 
used to pausing before I took pictures of all our food.&nbsp; He always 
remembered to order a bottle of water for us, which we were always in the mood 
for after all the walking in the sun.</font></p>

<img border="0" src="images/food/2007_05_31/italy_0002.JPG" width="594" height="480"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">In this situation, I was jealous of Miller's meat platter.&nbsp; 
What did I order again?&nbsp; I think a lemony chicken breast or something.&nbsp; 
Blah.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font size="4">Okay, some background here.&nbsp; I came to Italy looking for 
cannolis and was seriously dismayed to learn that cannolis were a Sicily thing.&nbsp; 
Italy still had some Sicilian cannolis, but they weren't that good.&nbsp; This 
one was though.&nbsp; Italy, however, had gelato (ice cream) at every corner, 
and they excelled at it.&nbsp; I had ricotta-flavored ice cream which was as 
good as a top-notch cannoli.&nbsp; I'm still dreaming about it.&nbsp; Also, that 
cup is holding a raspberry granite (pronounced &quot;granita&quot;).&nbsp; Picture a 
slushie made from raspberry pulp.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">In Positano, I had pumpkin gnocchi and Miller had a white 
pizza with something indiscernible on it.&nbsp; I think I won this one.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/food/2007_06_01/italy_0034.JPG" width="640" height="464"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">Prosciutto and melon.&nbsp; Very good!&nbsp; It was, 
fortunately, a common appetizer in Italy, but come to think of it, I can make it 
after a quick trip to the grocery store.&nbsp; Might not be the same, but my 
prosciutto palate is only so picky.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/food/2007_06_01/italy_0035.JPG" width="360" height="480"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">I think Miller ordered the carbonara this time.&nbsp; Did I 
order lasagna?&nbsp; I think I did once.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font size="4">Ah, the bike tour food.&nbsp; This is bruschetta and chicken 
liver pate, both absolutely divine.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/food/2007_06_04/italy_0028.JPG" width="640" height="480"></font></p>

<p><font size="4">I saw crepes on the menu once and had been looking for them 
since.&nbsp; At this restaurant, I found them and ordered them.&nbsp; Very good.&nbsp; 
Miller enjoyed his ravioli too.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font size="4">The most infamous food I ate in Italy was this, translated as 
&quot;raw meat&quot;.&nbsp; You can see it peeking out from under the lettuce and 
parmesan.&nbsp; It wasn't pretty, but if I wonder what something is like, even 
for a split second, I'm very tempted to try it.&nbsp; Unfortunately, I'm pretty 
sure this is what made me queasy the next day, so umm, stay away from the raw 
meat.&nbsp; Words of wisdom.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/food/2007_06_06/italy_0039.JPG" width="350" height="480"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">In Torcello, I made a point to order the local cheese, seen in 
the middle.&nbsp; We probably missed out a lot by not sampling the cheeses that 
much.&nbsp; Make a point to order cheese for appetizers sometimes if you go to 
Italy yourself.&nbsp; Eventually you start to appreciate the differences in 
cheeses.&nbsp; Watch the cholesterol though.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Even on the plane, I wouldn't let Miller eat without taking a 
picture of his food.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">
<img border="0" src="images/food/2007_06_07/italy_0006.JPG" width="640" height="480"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">It wasn't picture-worthy though.&nbsp; Well, one thing was.&nbsp; 
That cup of white and orange stuff was interesting.&nbsp; I tasted the white 
stuff, and it was exactly like Cool Whip, which is that whipped cream you buy 
that you scoop with a spoon instead of spray.&nbsp; I tried the orange stuff, 
and that tasted exactly like Cool Whip too.&nbsp; I was expecting something 
fruity.&nbsp; This concluded my trip to Italy.</font></p>
