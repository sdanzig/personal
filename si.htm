Infinity is a project I started October 17th, 1996 as a hobby during
college.&nbsp; It's classified as a MUD (Multi-User Dimension) which in layman's
terms can be described as this:</font></b></p>
<p style="line-height: 125%; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0" align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="line-height: 125%; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0" align="left"><b><font color="#00FFFF" size="4">A
place on the internet where lots of people can connect to and chat with each
other. (Much like IRC, a MUD is fully text-based as well ... just words, no
graphics.)&nbsp; In addition to the name you choose that other people see you
as, you design an entire character for yourself.&nbsp; Upon login, you write up
a description for yourself, choose your race, your statistics (strength,
intelligence, charisma, etc.) and finally log in as the character you
created.&nbsp; You have an inventory with some neat stuff such as weapons, food,
armor, a map, a torch, and other adventuring supplies and strange baubles and
artifacts you gather during your travels.&nbsp; That's right, you can travel
too.&nbsp; You start out in a room that has a description you can read.&nbsp;
There might be other things in this room that you can look at or do other things
with.</font></b></p>

<p style="line-height: 125%; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0" align="left"><b><font color="#00FFFF" size="4">There's
a few &quot;tutorial rooms&quot; that new characters are forced to go through to
give you a feel for the MUD.&nbsp; Once done with the tutorial, you can move
from room to room, adventuring around the hundreds upon hundreds of rooms to
explore, solving quests, finding treasures, fighting off a variety of foes, some
controlled by other people currently connected.&nbsp; You are not left to fend
for yourself, however.&nbsp; There are lots of other people connected to Split
Infinity that are willing to help you when you need it.&nbsp; Also, the
population of Split Infinity is diverse.&nbsp; The coding team that helps
develop this project&nbsp; include people from not only all over the United
States but also from countries such as Sweden, Germany, Denmark, Australia,
Holland, England, South Africa, Canada and Mexico.&nbsp; View the official web
