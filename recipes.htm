<font size="4">Ever since I first moved into an apartment and 
had my own kitchen, cooking became a frequent hobby of mine. It provided good 
stress relief after a hard day of computer programming.&nbsp; I have an obsession 
for good food, especially French and German, and I have plenty of experience 
with desserts.&nbsp; Anyway, I seem to have gotten rave reviews over the years 
from family, friends and coworkers, so I figured I'd provide my versions of the 
most successful recipes on my web page. Feel free to 
<a href="mailto:scottdanzig@yahoo.com">email me</a> your favorites as 
well and I'll add them. I also can add recipes upon request.</font>
