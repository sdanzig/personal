<br>

<font size="-1"><big><br>

Welcome to Prague, a medieval-themed, touristy city with castles, puppetry, fun little souvenirs, and meat and potatoes.<br>


<br>


<br>


<img src="images/prague/DSCN0022.jpg" alt=""><br>


I settle into the holiday apartment we rented and practice Russian on
my computer.&nbsp; At this point, I've been studying with tutors for a
year.&nbsp; Aliona speaks English, Russian and Belarusian, while her
mother and aunt (who were going to stay with us) speak Russian and
Belarusian.&nbsp; So you see how I might have been nervous.&nbsp; I was
determined to communicate with them on my own in some way.<br>


<br>


<br>


<img src="images/prague/DSCN0024.jpg" alt=""><br>


Here's a view of the street outside our apartment.&nbsp; We were situated close to the Charles Bridge.<br>


<br>


<br>


<img src="images/prague/DSCN0027.jpg" alt=""><br>


We met Aliona's mother and aunt, Marina and Valentina, at the train
station.&nbsp; It was a heart-warming reunion, as Aliona misses her
family and home a great deal since her asylum years ago.<br>


<br>


<br>


<img src="images/prague/DSCN0028.jpg" alt=""><br>


Marina works as a florist and has a great appreciation for
flowers.&nbsp; She brought these for Aliona, and here they're set up
for display in our shared apartment.<br>


<br>


<br>


<img src="images/prague/DSCN0029.jpg" alt=""><br>


This vacation convinced me that we should never, when possible, rent a
hotel room.&nbsp; The apartment was cheaper, much roomier, and had all
the facilities of home.&nbsp; No annoying housekeeping to worry about
when sleeping in.&nbsp; Plus, Aliona's relatives were cooking for us
frequently, so we were very well fed.<br>


<br>


<br>


<img src="images/prague/DSCN0032.jpg" alt=""><br>


The apartment was fairly trendy-looking too.&nbsp; This was our main bathroom.<br>


<br>


<br>


<img src="images/prague/DSCN0034.jpg" alt=""><br>Valentina sporting her
version of the 'fro.&nbsp; While looking at this photo, I initially
thought this was Marina.&nbsp; Identical twins should wear clearly
visible nametags for photos.<br>


<br>


<br>


<img src="images/prague/DSCN0035.jpg" alt=""><br>

Enough dilly-dallying.&nbsp; Time to get ready to explore Prague.<br>

<br>

<br>


<img src="images/prague/IMG_0347.JPG" alt=""><br>


The most recognizable tourist site in Prague is the Old Town Square,
complete with the astronomical clock.&nbsp; Aliona introduced me to her
"top 10" travel guides she likes buying.&nbsp; Here she reads one for
Prague.<br>


<br>


<br>


<img src="images/prague/IMG_0353.jpg" alt=""><br>

The Old Town Square was full of snacks, including these cylindrical
treats which was basically sugary dough wrapped around a log and
slow-roasted.<br>

<br>

<br>

<img src="images/prague/IMG_0454.jpg" alt=""><br>

If you touch this donkey, you'll be required to admit it later on your customs form.<br>

<br>


<br>

<img src="images/prague/IMG_0431.jpg" alt=""><br>

European buildings always look haunted at night.<br>

<br>

<br>


<img src="images/prague/DSCN0040.jpg" alt=""><br>


We arrive near the Charles Bridge, at the Vltava River.<br>


<br>


<br>


<img src="images/prague/DSCN0042.jpg" alt=""><br>


Here we block other tourists and locals from enjoying their day.<br>


<br>


<br>


<img src="images/prague/DSCN0043.jpg" alt=""><br>


A statue of Jesus's feet adorns the Charles Bridge.<br>


<br>


<br>


<img src="images/prague/DSCN0045.jpg" alt=""><br>


Further down was a statue of St. Arithmetic holding a golden plus sign.<br>

<br>


<br>


<img src="images/prague/DSCN0047.jpg" alt=""><br>


We were eventually pushed aside by people we were blocking.&nbsp; We rested a while to recover.<br>


<br>


<br>


<img src="images/prague/DSCN0048.jpg" alt=""><br>

Aliona's mother and aunt are identical twins.&nbsp; You can tell they certainly are different, but they're both goofy.<br>

<br>

<br>


<img src="images/prague/IMG_0360.JPG" alt=""><br>


A statue of Jesus was mounted above the statue of Jesus's feet.<br>


<br>


<br>


<img src="images/prague/IMG_0361.jpg" alt=""><br>


Here's a view of the Prague Castle, the Vltava River, and the side of the Charles Bridge which wasn't under construction.<br>


<br>


<br>


<img src="images/prague/IMG_0364.jpg" alt=""><br>


The ones on the right are tourists heading to the Prague Castle.&nbsp; Those on the left are heading to the Old Town Square.<br>


<br>


<br>


<img src="images/prague/IMG_0366.jpg" alt=""><br>


Renovation can be beautiful.<br>


<br>


<br>


<img src="images/prague/DSCN0049.jpg" alt=""><br>


On the Prague Castle-side of the Charles Bridge, tourists passed
through an archway that makes you feel like a knight approaching the
castle.<br>


<br>


<br>


<img src="images/prague/DSCN0050.jpg" alt=""><br>


Marina wanted to be a knight too.<br>


<br>


<br>


<img src="images/prague/DSCN0053.jpg" alt=""><br>


Prague is known for its beautiful garnet jewelry, but garnets are
red.&nbsp; So these are just nice-looking pendants made of something
else.<br>

<br>

<br>

<img src="images/prague/IMG_0370.jpg" alt=""><br>

They still look cool.&nbsp; After watching this swirl around mystically for a while, a ghost appeared and scared us off.<br>


<br>


<br>


<img src="images/prague/DSCN0055.jpg" alt=""><br>


Any street you photograph in Prague will look distinctly European.<br>


<br>


<br>


<img src="images/prague/DSCN0056.jpg" alt=""><br>


Where there were beautiful flowers, there was Marina.&nbsp; I particularly like the happy sunflower man.<br>


<br>


<br>


<img src="images/prague/DSCN0060.jpg" alt=""><br>


We had our share of stairs to climb approaching the Prague Castle.<br>


<br>


<br>


<img src="images/prague/DSCN0062.jpg" alt=""><br>


Lots of stairs and a brick wall made a good spot to advertise our jeans.<br>


<br>


<br>


<img src="images/prague/DSCN0064.jpg" alt=""><br>


These stairs taught me that Marina is in very good shape.<br>


<br>


<br>


<img src="images/prague/DSCN0071.JPG" alt=""><br>


Here we brought the citizens of Prague to tears with our masterful tango.<br>


<br>


<br>


<img src="images/prague/DSCN0075.jpg" alt=""><br>


After Aliona emigrated to the US, she saw her mother only one other
time, and she was very ill.&nbsp; I made sure she was very healthy for
this trip.&nbsp; See the results here.<br>


<br>


<br>


<img src="images/prague/DSCN0076.jpg" alt=""><br>


She appreciated my thoughtfulness.<br>


<br>


<br>


<img src="images/prague/DSCN0079.jpg" alt=""><br>


She also appreciated the location.&nbsp; Aliona has been to Prague
before, but it's a gorgeous city that I personally couldn't get enough
of.<br>


<br>


<br>


<img src="images/prague/DSCN0082.jpg" alt=""><br>


Marina and Valentina took frequent smoking breaks, but only outdoors.<br>


<br>


<br>


<img src="images/prague/DSCN0083.jpg" alt=""><br>


I believe in point and shoot cameras being better-suited for vacations
than high-end DSLRs.&nbsp; It takes away from the enjoyment of the
vacation if you have something heavy strapped around your neck all the
time.&nbsp; Also, point and shoot cameras these days are capable of
taking very impressive pictures, especially if you know how to work
with their limitations.<br>


<br>


<br>


<img src="images/prague/DSCN0085.jpg" alt=""><br>


Street performers in Prague are pretty classy.<br>


<br>


<br>


<img src="images/prague/DSCN0087.jpg" alt=""><br>


Marina makes fun of this poor guard outside of Prague Castle.<br>


<br>


<br>


<img src="images/prague/DSCN0088.jpg" alt=""><br>


The guard, basking in embarrassment, is also forced to endure me and Aliona.<br>


<br>


<br>


<img src="images/prague/IMG_0436.jpg" alt=""><br>

This too would look haunted at night.<br>

<br>

<br>


<img src="images/prague/DSCN0096.JPG" alt=""><br>


Here are the ghosts.<br>


<br>


<br>


<img src="images/prague/DSCN0102.jpg" alt=""><br>


The courtyard of Prague Castle was perfect for skateboarders.&nbsp; In
fact, we saw one little boy on a scooter zooming around, having the
time of his life.<br>


<br>


<br>


<img src="images/prague/DSCN0108.JPG" alt=""><br>


St. Vitus's haunted cathedral was largely ignored by the boy on the scooter.<br>


<br>


<br>


<img src="images/prague/DSCN0110.jpg" alt=""><br>


At times, we just rested on benches.&nbsp; This was one of those times.<br>


<br>


<br>


<img src="images/prague/DSCN0114.jpg" alt=""><br>


Marina rests as well, which was rare.<br>


<br>


<br>


<img src="images/prague/DSCN0120.JPG" alt=""><br>


Valentina takes a picture of something very high.<br>


<br>


<br>


<img src="images/prague/DSCN0125.jpg" alt=""><br>


Crown jewels on display in Prague Castle.<br>


<br>


<br>


<img src="images/prague/DSCN0131.jpg" alt=""><br>


Aliona defies the Czech Republic's rule of law.<br>


<br>


<br>


<img src="images/prague/DSCN0135.jpg" alt=""><br>


The numbers on these books reminded me of the Dewey Decimal system.<br>


<br>


<br>


<img src="images/prague/DSCN0140.jpg" alt=""><br>


This was the dining room in our apartment.<br>


<br>


<br>


<img src="images/prague/DSCN0148.JPG" alt=""><br>


We took a chance and tried playing the pipe organ.&nbsp; The ghosts of
St. Vitus's cathedral rattled their chains at us until we stopped.<br>


<br>


<br>


<img src="images/prague/DSCN0157.jpg" alt=""><br>

The queens of Prague castle enjoyed overlooking their subjects.<br>

<br>

<br>


<img src="images/prague/DSCN0179.JPG" alt=""><br>


Every so often something flashy seems to deserve a picture.&nbsp; Speaking of flashy, I think I accidentally used it on this.<br>


<br>


<img src="images/prague/IMG_0446.jpg" alt=""><br>

Near the castle was Prague's "Golden Lane", filled with everything
Prague is known for, except for big impractical things like Old Town
Square and the Vltava River.<br>

<br>

<br>


<img src="images/prague/DSCN0191.JPG" alt=""><br>


A medieval knight certainly can find some deals on outfits in the Golden Lane.<br>


<br>


<br>


<img src="images/prague/DSCN0194.JPG" alt=""><br>


This shield is undamaged because the severed lion head scares off attackers very effectively.<br>


<br>


<br>


<img src="images/prague/DSCN0195.JPG" alt=""><br>


We figured the spiked chair would look good in our living room, so we had it shipped home.<br>


<br>


<br>


<img src="images/prague/DSCN0200.JPG" alt=""><br>


Prague is also famous for colorful window displays.<br>


<br>


<br>


<img src="images/prague/DSCN0204.jpg" alt=""><br>

Marina liked taking pictures of goofy things like rope-legged mice and bunnies.<br>

<br>

<br>


<img src="images/prague/IMG_0448.jpg" alt=""><br>


Aliona buys another souvenir.&nbsp; We figured it would look good next to our spiked chair.<br>

<br>


<br>


<img src="images/prague/DSCN0207.jpg" alt=""><br>


Outside of a medieval-themed restaurant, this prisoner struggles for survival.<br>


<br>


<br>

<img src="images/prague/IMG_0449.jpg" alt=""><br>

Heeeelllllp meeeee...<br>

<br>

<br>


<img src="images/prague/DSCN0208.jpg" alt=""><br>


We finished up and as we were returning across the Charles Bridge, we
saw this little marionette rocking out beneath the shadow of a street
performer.<br>


<br>


<br>


<img src="images/prague/DSCN0213.jpg" alt=""><br>


The horse-drawn carriage was the most popular form of transportation in Prague, before the advent of cars.<br>


<br>


<br>


<img src="images/prague/DSCN0216.JPG" alt=""><br>


I exclaimed "Klyuchi!" to Aliona's relatives, which means "keys".&nbsp;
They thought I was crazy until they saw this sculpture I was pointing
at, consisting of lots of keys.<br>


<br>


<br>


<img src="images/prague/DSCN0217.jpg" alt=""><br>


More goofy rope-legged statues.<br>


<br>


<br>


<img src="images/prague/DSCN0218.jpg" alt=""><br>


Window shopping is enough reason to visit Prague.<br>


<br>


<br>


<img src="images/prague/IMG_0372.jpg" alt=""><br>


This glass ape bullies the tiny glass pig.<br>


<br>


<br>


<img src="images/prague/IMG_0374.jpg" alt=""><br>


Prague is the place to go for anything theatrical.<br>


<br>


<br>


<img src="images/prague/IMG_0375.jpg" alt=""><br>


This little Satan sculpture is adorable.<br>


<br>

<br>


<img src="images/prague/IMG_0380.jpg" alt=""><br>


The Czech are not shy of eating a lot of meat and potatoes.&nbsp; This is how you advertise to a hungry Czech.<br>


<br>


<br>


<img src="images/prague/IMG_0381.jpg" alt=""><br>


The Prague streets were never boring.<br>


<br>


<br>


<img src="images/prague/IMG_0387.jpg" alt=""><br>


I spent ten minutes taking pictures of these fun little sheep, trying to get the best angle possible.&nbsp; This was the winner.<br>


<br>


<br>


<img src="images/prague/IMG_0393.jpg" alt=""><br>


Here's Prague's legendary "Lennon Wall".&nbsp; Aliona thought she was worried when I said, "Graffiti? I don't see any graffiti."<br>


<br>


<br>


<img src="images/prague/IMG_0407.jpg" alt=""><br>


Aliona found out from her mother that there really was graffiti.<br>


<br>


<br>


<img src="images/prague/IMG_0408.jpg" alt=""><br>


It takes something as psychedelic as the Lennon Wall to stand out in colorful Prague.<br>


<br>


<br>


<img src="images/prague/IMG_0412.jpg" alt=""><br>


Aliona takes a momentary rest from punching me in vengeance to pose for another picture.<br>


<br>


<br>


<img src="images/prague/IMG_0416.jpg" alt=""><br>


Padlocks symbolize a couple's love.<br>


<br>


<br>


<img src="images/prague/IMG_0418.JPG" alt=""><br>


Aliona did not see the creepy screwed-up head baby statue about to crawl over her.<br>


<br>


<br>


<img src="images/prague/IMG_0424.jpg" alt=""><br>


A bird waits for a tourist to drop something tasty.<br>


<br>


<br>


<img src="images/prague/IMG_0427.jpg" alt=""><br>


We stop in a grocery store and this dead fish poses for a close-up.<br>


<br>


<br>


<img src="images/prague/DSCN0224.jpg" alt=""><br>


Here's our group ordering authentic Czech food.&nbsp; Both Russian and
English speakers have little problem communicating in Prague.&nbsp; On
a linguistic note, I found my knowledge of Russian let me understand a
decent lot of Czech as well.<br>


<br>


<br>


<img src="images/prague/DSCN0227.jpg" alt=""><br>


I never sat still in a restaurant while waiting for my food.<br>

<br>

<br>


<img src="images/prague/IMG_0378.jpg" alt=""><br>


Food in the Czech Republic had a way of getting your attention.&nbsp;
"Blah!&nbsp; I'm your food!"&nbsp; My train of thought was gone.<br>

<br>


<br>


<img src="images/prague/DSCN0233.JPG" alt=""><br>


Here was another meal that Valentina put an end to.<br>


<br>


<br>


<img src="images/prague/DSCN0240.jpg" alt=""><br>


I admit I filtered out some of the countless flower pictures Marina was taking.&nbsp; I chose the ones I thought were pretty.<br>


<br>


<br>


<img src="images/prague/DSCN0241.jpg" alt=""><br>


On a similarly crazy note, Marina saw this walking cloud float by and
ran quite a distance after it, determined to get a picture.<br>


<br>


<br>


<img src="images/prague/DSCN0242.jpg" alt=""><br>


We had signed up for an authentic marionette show in a historic Prague theater.&nbsp; Wolfgang hosts the show.<br>


<br>


<br>


<img src="images/prague/DSCN0245.JPG" alt=""><br>


This tiny actress's performance was too orchestrated and controlled, and to be frank, even a little stiff.<br>


<br>


<br>


<img src="images/prague/DSCN0250.jpg" alt=""><br>


Little grim reapers spook the stage as the tiny actress gets ready for
her next solo.&nbsp; I actually successfully explained some of what was
going on in Russian to Aliona's mother during the performance.&nbsp; It
was a very rewarding intercultural experience.<br>


<br>


<br>


<img src="images/prague/DSCN0257.jpg" alt=""><br>


I do admire marionette theater because it's very non-pretentious.&nbsp;
Everyone, including the performers, are there because they want to be
there.<br>


<br>


<br>


<img src="images/prague/DSCN0261.JPG" alt=""><br>


Our souvenir, this shifty little gypsy, liked to kick everyone and
everything.&nbsp; It was quite rude, but no one had a clue about why
she acted this way.<br>


<br>


<br>


<img src="images/prague/DSCN0262.jpg" alt=""><br>
